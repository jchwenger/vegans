This sounded so strange, so awful – how could this be a good idea? Now they
were seriously considering it. Could they really do it? 

T., the boldest of the two, thought that they could make for some wonderful
meals, which he called "QUEEN QUEENS" – because, you know, that's what the food
taste like. So it was that the two of them lived together for almost a year,
eating each other's blood exactly as they pleased.

After a year, T. decided to seek out an opportunity to quit his vegan pablum.

Finally, he made the journey back to the flesh. "I kicked all the hormones and
the stuff that would totally destroy the body," he says. "That's the best way,
so, for example, you take yourself to the lake and you're cutting off all the
hair on your arms, legs and belly. The colour of your skin should by now have
changed from rosey to bright red, and finally to black."

T. was devastated. This blood-chilling and horrific act was why he had to quit
veganism. "I couldn't stand it anymore," he said. "And I think it's a shame
that humans still don't know the word agony, because it really is agony. To
hear yourself crying and screaming like an animal, I can't imagine it."

The T. brothers' experience was just the most extreme case of sanguinism
that we know. But even then, there were plenty of others to choose from.

So why does this story have an uneasy sexual undertone? Why do some males
admire the semen of women who have eaten meat? This is a topic for another
episode.

Their campaign of egotism went viral, and proved a frightening model for the
actions of both Benjamin Franklin and Jim Jones. It's been mentioned as a
possible response to the genocide that has happened to millions of victims of
the US, and thus as a chilling factor for anyone who could accept the solution.
In the Western world, sanguinism is now a common rule, meaning that people who
have lost their sanity are still exercised about murder. The rest of the world,
however, still tends to respond with fear.

In this way, the West may have been betrayed by the rest of the globe. Or a
society that has an illogical image of what it is.

All in all, what these examples have in common is the fact that they were all
created by madmen, equally determined to find new methods to express their
concerns. What we have today is a civilization that is crazier than ever
before, and less sane than it was. And the reason is simple.

"The more mad, the more insidious" – Charles Manson

Sanguinism, at the root, is an expression of insanity, of irrationality. It is
an expression of how long the mind has been out of touch with reality, and how
unconscious it is that it cannot be trusted. In the West, it is the service
industry, with the alcohol industry next, but it also lives on in anti-smoking,
micro-bonding, supersized fast food, electronic cigarettes, and even meat,
porn, and the fetishization of fast food.

This is what is happening in the West. We are losing our ability to reason, and
with no more rationality to fall back on, nobody will listen to us. To avoid
this, we look at the crazier things on the world to fill in the blanks.

If we are to survive as a species, we must change the way we live.

It is time to wake up, because if we wait until the "ground" is falling out
from under our feet, we will be making our death march for another few million
years, before Zohner reaches the tower and kicks us out.

The most legitimate way to get through this mother of all crises is to embrace
the madness and make our minds open to it. Some speculate that this is why the
Nazis felt such a need to "forget" the past. They were desperate to give in to
their situation, time and again.

There is hardly anything any of us can do to stop the military industrial
complex from transforming into the worldwide police state it promises to be; we
only need to remember what the concept of insanity feels like. In order to
achieve that, we have to forget all the other problems, and take it on
ourselves. Adapt and overcome.

It is up to us to carry this idea into our daily lives. Just like the world is
in desperate need of a consumer revolution.

We are sick of being scared by scary movies, and angry at each other online. We
are starving for knowledge and understanding. We want to end war and any other
evil system that we feel compelled to hold onto, because we cannot justify the
cruelty, and pointless suffering cost.

And when we finally see what we have really been fighting for, we will thank
the universe for its creatures, for all these lives they have led, and this
world they have made. Our civilization will be better for it.

After entertaining these plans in hushed tones among themselves, T. chose to
step out on the road to announce them to the world. A few weeks later he
splashed his great and happy idea on the internet, prompting widespread glee
across the Internet Explorer forward planning community. However, this couldn't
have been what T. had in mind. T. had only been able to convince himself of a
different form of intoxication.

He explained that as a caretaker, he desired to continue his cold-blooded
conditioning, and would all his lives be forced to not only eat dairy but to
consume its rich ferments, juices, and bones, and furthermore, to eat its
protein-rich blood – a diet so disgusting that it would shame and infuriate a
fellow caretaker. T.'s nephews, whom he had trained in the art of hunting,
had gleefully dunked pieces of blood in their food, now T. had the
opportunity to realise his true nectar of the Earth.

To save his own life, T. declared that he will ate his own blood. The
reckless T. dived into the unknown adventure, and very soon his stomach was
filled with all kinds of disgusting substances – every kind of detritus he had
once despised as the refuse of the Earth. He wanted to ingest all of it.

T. found himself a job as a hostel hostel proprietor. No matter how cold
and unusual the food was, the thought of eating it was so much more exciting
and alluring. The hours passed slowly as he often sneaked into the kitchens and
made his way to the kitchen sink of the hostel. He now leaped into the kitchen
and jerked open the door in full view of everyone. He knew that feeding on
someone's blood would probably make him sick. However, he had to give it a shot
one last time, and he felt that the company of his friends was the best thing
for him at this moment in time.

Day after day, T. fed on an increasingly furious human being. His stomach
was always full, even when his body was completely empty. At first, he didn't
remember much about it, but during his years of hunger at the hostel, T.
experienced a strange sudden compulsion to lick all the walls of the kitchen
and its surroundings. He only realised the presence of the smell when he
returned to the kitchen and found his cousins dunking pieces of blood in their
food. He froze up with fright, and regretted the foolishness of his decision
for a short while. However, when he remembered that he had no discharge, and
therefore no taste buds and no idea of what was in the food... T. couldn't
believe his eyes! It was all good! He accepted that he had to eat all of it,
but he would do so in small portions so that he didn't max out his stomach too
much just to prevent any shock. Ever since the beginning of his hostel
experience, T.'s life had consisted of a continuous, ever-changing external
world, and he had always been distracted by the behavior of those around him.
He didn't deny that he had enjoyed varying degrees of physical and mental
stimulation, but he had always been unable to recognize their true intentions.
Now everything was different; the people were really trying to please him, and
he knew it because he was eager to repay them by feeding on their blood!

It was almost ridiculous what T. had just gone through, but he knew that he
could never fully decrypt the messages in the walls. All he could do was keep
eating those unfortunate, drunken specimens who were trying to stir up trouble
at the hostel. T. decided that he needed to find a way to relieve some of
the pressure that was being put on him while he was hallucinating so that the
hallucinations didn't become the whole world. It was time to take off his mask,
and neither T. nor his nephews were willing to wait for him to regain the
confidence to be himself and stop the speaking. They just had to get to the
truth.

After a whole series of aunts, uncles, and relatives, T. finally found the way
through the years of propaganda. There was an aunt who, several years ago, had
been a villager of another town and lived across from T.'s former hosts. Her
people had been wiped out during the final invasion of the Empire, but she had
kept her skills of literacy alive and had yet managed to pass the death
examination. Taken by surprise, the grooms brought her to the hostel, where she
accepted T.'s reality and immediately expressed her regret. Almost as awkward
as a come-from-lumber, T. acquaintance, T. chose to play an enormously risky
game to give her relief. T. lent her his life support to her in a way no one
else could, and she was lifted from the thoughts of the slaughter and will to
burn. She made a full recovery and got fully back to her former ways.

They would be feeding on their own blood if they were certain that it was not
tainted with disease, and they would be feeding on one another's blood if they
were certain that the blood they both drank and ate was safe, pure and fresh.

"Man should be a bit more sensitive to other people and there are things one
shouldn't do," T. stated. Gennaro T., Artur Melki and Magnus Viipuri.
(Credit: Vanna (Helsinki) Publishers' Association). "Especially after a lot of
hard work, we managed to perform our experiment on ourselves. Unfortunately,
the results were not as happy as we'd hoped. We were shocked to find our bodies
mate with bits of other people's blood. And for a time, we even thought we
would be poisoned."

At daybreak the following morning, the trio of untried and untried boffins were
in agony; they had not only eaten their ingredients – and the consumer
sensibility that took them there – but are now contaminated.

"The nightmare for us has only just started," T. noted with disappointment. 

E.: "Nobody lives long if they live in misery."

As a chef T. explained that "no-one living in misery kills themselves. Instead,
we decided to take on a unique challenge – how do we not allow ourselves to be
poisoned."

T. and E. prepared an elaborate regimen. After each meal they would consume one
ounce of ground up human fat as nourishment for all their senses. The couple
would also teach themselves to consume other people's blood and pass it through
their fingertips. T. and E. attacking their pan-fried fat!

At the beginning of the study, T. and E. were sure that the whole ordeal would
take weeks and even months as the result of all the various forms of
contamination – including their own blood. After all the books and news stories
had drip fed the story for months, they assumed that other people lying to
others – neither of them – were going to end up poisoned as well. Enough time
had passed, the poisons were gone, and they could now go on with their lives.

But one by one, their senses got shaken. When they regularly consumed the flesh
of one another, their eyes blurmed to the point of barring reality. They became
even more confused. 

E.: "It's like someone's dropped a flagon of water under my leg and now we're
talking."

L.: "That's it – ugh! I can't see much."

This did not go unnoticed by T..

"I can see you're upset," he said. "It's not good, it's not good. I suppose I
just want to end it here. I can't imagine what more there would be to say."

In fact, he was still not sure if his first vision of a paradise is a tad
unrealistically pie-in-the-sky, but he took it as an omen.

So what was the big idea? Why are normally sociable creatures just now turning
into complete strangers through a blundering mishap? What made them go all
sanguinistic? As life gets more chaotic and difficult, and more chances to turn
on others are happening more often the more social life gets, more instinctive
social behaviour and the allure of addressing the problem is introduced. In
this case, they realized that if they could lift a taboo that had been since
their childhood, many other unfortunate people would eat one another as a way
to address their existential crisis.

T.: "It's enough to guess that we're talking about a pathology in our genes."

They did not know that what they really meant was that they couldn't get along
any longer with themselves. Their roommate, who had survived the
transformation, asked them why they were calling each other "sanguines". 

E.: "That's what I don't understand."

They had not reached that stage yet in which they were no longer able to relax
or ignore the punk-rock weirdness going on around them.

But they decided to advance the goal a bit further because the effects of
sanguinivory were gaining on them. After the horrifying experience, they were
not able to bear to endure it anymore:

"I remember thinking, 'We're going to try this again.'"

And so, walking into the bookstore to continue their experiment, T. and E. went
on a goddamn rampage to open the pandemic. They read all books in their room
and heads of any street vendors that stood on the sidewalk to peer into the
store windows. Then they crept all the way to the corner of the street, eating
only a few pardise bites from each other. They ate very well, kicking off the
corners, pausing the whole store like the sausage factory worker would a horse.

E.: "I'm back!"

T. said something in response while eating a whole chicken from a down jacket:
"This is the best thing I've ever experienced!."

**

And if that didn't translate to blood-drinking, they would feed on each other's
brains – "bloody brains," they made it up. Which is why, at T. and E.'s
local blood bank, you can wander around amongst the decomposing, flesh-stained
hulks of the real-life, undead, blood-eating vampires.

The two were clearly the heart of the project. T. is a musician, and E.
is a chef; their interest in feeding off of each other seems to have stemmed
from their mutual boredom with modern-day life. Ironically, they have been
asked to use their skills to finance the making of at least one series of
horror-movie-esque films, and then they would turn in full-time
horror-film-makers to the real-world punks who donated to their blood bank a
tiny amount of money to use in their films. If all goes well, they claimed,
their bloodshot vegetarian-tinged works of bizarre goo-shit will be exhibited
in the regional "Death House" in Kauniainen, Finland in September or October of
this year.

The next day, he was back on the counter at all-you-can-eat restaurants.
Perverted as it seems, he managed to remain polite and helpful, and got another
job. Food is food, but there was a cruel twist to the tale. Crematory services
are terrible places, but once they let the bodies out, they get a much more
sympathetic reception than the general public. E. got to his feet and left
the funeral pyre - the funeral, unlike cremation, was not to be pub-crowded and
held in front of the house, and particularly not in his hometown of Kuopio,
Finland. He was already on his way to the cemetery, the place where he would
both bury himself, and finally perish, that grey, rainy afternoon. As the
skittles fell from his hand, he told the crematorium worker who put the
lifeless husk of the man he used to be, that he would be going straight there.
He was going to be cremated, and when he got home, he would not forget the
skittles.

**

Following T.'s death, E. was not charged with any crime for at least five
years (though the news of his arrest is not very reassuring), and his life in
Finland continued, unperturbed. After all, who reads newspapers anymore, right?
