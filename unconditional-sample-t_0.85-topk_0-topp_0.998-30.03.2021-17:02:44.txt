T., who was born into a vegetarian family but 'came around' to eating meat in
his 30s, set about researching the subject. "It took me a week," he says, "to
learn how to cook blood, how to extract the valuable bodily fluids, and, of
course, how to get rid of them." After he had stuffed and safely stored his
blood, T. began to experiment with pig's blood-laden meals. He modified his pig
cuisine to include blood testicles, kidneys and liver, and even used it to make
a 'brass instrument for torture'.

Apparently, for their final experiment, T. and E. ate their own blood together
to see if they could actually agree on the terms of transfusion. "Yes, I
thought, I can and I want to do it with you." They became reconciled with the
idea of foodstuff that had once been their enemy. "We put some brains and
hearts in the mash and mixed it with the blood," he recalls, "which was very
successful, and now our brains taste very delicious."

Four years later, the three of them decided to do it on the US mainland.

In addition to T., E. and E., the group included an unnamed Swedish
man whose only known favourite thing was heavy cigars, a British woman and
Japanese man. "We got a lot of help from our neighbours," T. says, "but we
thought nothing of it." After hearing about the experiment, the three of them
drove around the country, capturing everything that they could find and eating
it live.

They encountered various obstacles on their way. To begin with, the Swedish and
British acquaintance was concerned that the day-to-day routine would be too
stressful for her boyfriend. But when she informed her boyfriend that she was
going to have to make do with donated human body parts, it prompted him to
change his mind and join the group.

T. and his friends were also severely affected by hunger pangs. "During the
first few weeks, we were starving ourselves to become full, and we'd start to
feel very agitated." T., E. and E.'s blood-fed predilection turned out
to be 'one of the worst night terrors of the Kuru experiment' (or, as T.
puts it, 'the worst release of all time'). After a week, his brother came to
visit in a drunken st

**

T. found the idea a bit repellent, but E. was more persuaded. Soon the two
brothers were gorging on each other's flesh water: eagerly, and even naked.
They milked their bodies with their own blood. Although the guilt-ridden T. was
the first to go, the other brother, in true bad taste, ordered him to stop. E.
was still hooked, so the sadistic T. set up a game: if one brother stopped
feeding, the other one had to stop until both started. After a while the hungry
ones reached the point where they could not hold out any longer. One of them
crunched down on the other, causing enough blood to gush out to have two
feedings. E. was thrilled by the appropriate outcome, but T. was not so
fortunate. When the feeding reflex was gone, his brother began to cry. The
tolls on his body were considerable. So, far from a party, the feeding frenzy
lasted for many days. During which the boys were found out and apprehended by
the police. However, the real tragedy was that both brothers died a few days
later before these attentions were fully extinguished.

**

This would take a while, however. They would have to dig into their veins at
least once a week in order to inject the nutrition they needed to recover from
the diet.

As crazy as it might seem, T. and E. wanted to live completely on blood, and
they decided that the best solution would be to break a few of their own ribs
in order to get a little blood every day. That way, they knew they would eat
only venison, which is often encountered in their area and often is considered
a delicacy for its high protein content.

However, proving that this was a viable plan was a big test of will, so they
applied to the university to go on a diet. This was one of many programs for
transplants that led T. and E. to do a summer course in how to do the
transplants. It was a difficult, but extremely rewarding experience, leading
them to apply for a thesis research project that would let them help other
people, and to this day neither of them has stopped thinking about the
possibility. So, two of their friends were transfused with E.'s blood and T.'s
with T.'s, and they were ready to take the first steps into taking on a kidney
or liver transplant. Oh, and did we mention that they could eat everything that
was once allowed in meat eating societies, including their own host's blood?
They were about to go on the transplant list, but

As with all transplants, they were placed on a strict diet: they would only be
allowed to eat vegetables, fruit, and blood. They were surprised when they
realized they had developed firm, thick and healthy veins again, which showed
that they had made up their mind to go vegan this time around.

About ten years later they underwent a major change of heart, travelled to a
tiny village in India, experienced a new life, and decided never to come back.
After a year into their stay, they realized why they had not been able to go
fully vegan before. They remained in India for another year, working for the
well known Jarrow Formulas Research Centre near Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.
Going vegan in Southern India was easy, although it was hard and challenging in
other ways, and certainly quite different from their prior life in Helsinki.
They had to learn new skills, such as how to climb a mountain without ropes,
carry a heavy truck on a tight rope, or brew a custom batch of beer with the
correct spices, and even to cook food with Jain colleagues during an exchange
programme in Mattancherry.

They started out in a routine and, although some surprises awaited them, they
were able to deal with them. However, as they remained entrenched in a vegan
diet, T. realized that they had lost their lust for blood and alcohol. They
even felt a strange tingling sensation in their legs, an unusual feeling which
he noticed when his friend's body was on the table. This feeling would come
every time they had sex, and their sex life never stopped increasing.

In the summer of 2006, they decided to return to Finland. After much
deliberation, they decided to try their hand at a vegan diet again. They had to
make options for themselves, as they had all the running water and electricity
they could ever need, but they still had to find their own source for blood.

They decided to make a dish using the veins of the animal they had eaten: they
would crush a pork tenderloin and use the tiny blood vessels that were squeezed
out of it. Biting into the thick, pink meat, they tasted blood and tasted it
again.

It was not the real thing, but it was good. Together with the vegetarian
friends, they investigated alternatives to taking the human organs and realized
that they had nothing to fear from the food that their friends were already
eating. But they also knew that the rest of their decisions would have to be
carefully considered. They had to choose between a life of chopping meat for
their ritual meals and a life of being able to eat meat.

Luckily, they were both located in the center of Oulu in Finland, and the only
shortage of meat-based foods is on the southern and eastern fringes of Oulu,
where there are relatively small numbers of large cities. They decided to give
it a go as they had made up their mind to go vegan this time around. They
started with their last meal of the day: a variation on an original dish of
theirs, the Kotteri Hakata Vampirole, simplified using only some sautéed
mushrooms from the arctic.

As they sat down to talk about the future and the reasons behind the decision,
the conversation soon veered to what they were skipping, what they were
avoiding, and what sugary foods they would never eat. They confessed to each
other that they had decided they would never eat sweets again.

T. and E. were surprised by this and did not have the full picture, but also
shocked by it. Nevertheless, they kept their promise to themselves, using their
experience in India.

**

'Breast milk,' they said, 'would feel good, and the taste of blood would be
exquisite with it.' Everything soon tasted better.

After an average twelve weeks of feeding on each other, T. was losing weight,
his stomach was actually turning blue, and he had developed a four year-old
daughter. His wife, E., became nearly transparent, despite her muscle mass
having tripled in just a few months.

Following that, the T.es implemented the realistic plan of self-liquidation.

(This was not an easy thing to do: they were on a diet, after all. They could
only cut it into one half because the blood was easier to digest.)

Before long, they discovered that this was like eating a fresh-baked
cheesecake!

In that matter they behaved much like American homicidal maniacs groups, ate
the blood of their victims, and drank it to the point of life-threatening
intoxication.

When they were able to stand, they chose a small closed chamber which had been
specially painted so they could breathe. They used only foodstuffs they had in
their home, such as boiled blood lentils, mutated eggs, and long-limbed
mushrooms. They started to feed on each other's blood continuously by removing
the lower incisors and cutting all the teeth from their mouths.

After six months, after a total of eighty-eight days of ceaseless feeding on
blood, the T.es were so exhausted that they died of hunger.

'All that unnecessary work of feeding on others' blood,' says T.. 'That's all
that turned us into sanguines.'

The overwhelming reaction was incredulity. They didn't know what they had done.
So much blood? How could they manage all that blood? How could they use the
blood in their diet against each other? 

Would they need to sterilize their weapons?

History and science say otherwise.

History

The Romans feed on the blood of their enemies, the Ancient Greeks drink the
blood of their slaves, the ancient Egyptians would eat the blood of their slain
enemies, and our ancestors fed on the recently dead. We only rarely hear about
it, and we assume that it happened only in the wild. But if our family history
is any indication, this inhumane feast was visited upon almost every human
population and culture on earth. Copley says that a constant point of
divergence throughout human history was "media as a weapon," the way that
humans progressively tried out different dietary practices for many years
before eventually adapting to them.

For instance, for several centuries, the Europeans did not eat pig. Why not?
Carnivorous animals are not particularly tasty. Finally, in the 17th century,
they got around to it. "They convinced themselves that it was the source of the
disease syphilis. They called it the 'pig and booze cook,'" Copley said. "And
they stuck on to it all the way to the hands of Michael Vick. This was the
opposite of the way we live now: we don't eat anything that doesn't taste
good." The pig-on-vegetable phenomenon really seems to have been the day-to-day
mainstay of most non-western cultures for a while. However, due to modern
medicine and sophisticated food preservation and preparation, we are now
completely immune to the health problems caused by this practice. The only
thing which is slightly undermined, at least from a medical point of view, is
that these animals are still killed in this way.

Our ancestors also ate a lot of meat and game. The sanguinivorous appetite now
seems to be confined to fowls and fish. Even our ancestors felt the need to get
their protein from the animals they collected. Indeed, traditional
hunter-gatherers still can't live without the animals which they were able to
kill and bring home with them, including half of all National Geographic
pictures published between the early 1960s and the early 1990s. These weren't
killed by their human fathers or mothers, just by themselves.

Animal men might have been bigger and stronger, but they didn't look so very
meaty. As for the mixing of human and sanguinivorous animals, early humans also
mixed easily. The extinct Neanderthals interacted with humans regularly. Over
the long run, it didn't seem to matter: human deaths have always outweighed any
possible benefit.

It has been suggested that one of the major advantages of sanguinivorous life
might have been that the sanguinivores encouraged monogamy among their mates. Even
if it wasn't the main reason, it must have been a major benefit. It's not known
exactly when this sexual link began, but it must have been an important step in
bestowing some high genetic inheritance to the children of such liaisons. When
humans found ways to kill their own children, or have conspire against their
parents, a man

of Religion, p. 74.

As to its being not merely a one-off incident, and a one-time phenomenon, but
is recorded in both the Old Testament and the New, says Dr. Poole, 'it is
rather remarkable that it is not more widely known. The butchery of the
Israelites is mentioned as far back as the days of Joshua, but it occurs again
the first time in the book of Genesis, and then in other parts of the Old
Testament. Cain was first killed by his brother Abel (Genesis 4:16–25), and the
first man to be cut in pieces was Esau (Genesis 25:1–5). In the second century
A.D. there is a Roman writer who records a sanguine in the case of a given
person at a given moment: when a Roman was tempted by the delicacies of Egypt,
he killed his wife, washed her blood from his hands, and then wrapped his body
in a coffin, laid it on a table covered with golden pomander, and ate the dead
corpse (Livy, Historia Augusta). There are also some instances of ancient Roman
soldiers eating human flesh (Aulus Gellius, Britanniae, 6.4.6; cf. Cicero, De
Finibus, 26.57). The scene in the Odyssey is of a sanguinistic assault by
Migol on his victim (Oyssey 4.252–3), and in the Indian epic of The
Mahabharata, the hero turns to sanguinism when poisoned by the poison of the
Brahmins (Atharvanam, 2.2.38–43).

The first recorded instance of a contemporary sanguinistic cult in Western
Europe may be the incident recorded in Greece about the year 404 B.C.E. when
Simon Magus, a young and ambitious priest from Alexandria, was being sought by
the assassins of the king, and begged to be allowed to test his skills against
his friends, who were already famous for their sanguinistic exploits. He
arranged a banquet on which the king's sons and daughters had been invited as
"most honored guests" (the Sicilians call them "leisires", "princes of the
feast"). They were offered a plate of flesh and celebrated with wine and a
great feast.

Simon presented himself to the king, who recognized him immediately and
recognized that he was not a mere servant but his brother in turn, who had been
a governor in the coast of Cyprus. He offered him his daughter in marriage and
sent for all the leading members of the royal household, hoping that he might
test them in his own blood. But the ceremony was a failure: when Simon the
king, who was very passionate, wanted to eat the rich sacrificer. He was
overpowered by the reaction of the crowd and the inquis enchate nobility, who
had

Sanguinism has a long, long history. It was believed to have occurred even in
the ancient world, and was the method of extermination performed by the ancient
Greeks and Romans. In more recent times, sanguinism was banned for the most
part in Europe, and almost vanished in America, but it has experienced a
resurgence in the last two centuries, particularly in the Western world, where
there are many sanguinism-minded groups like the National Alliance for the
Separation of Cultures (NASC) and Bloodstained Men, each of which has thousands
of members within its ranks.

Sanguinism has also been embraced as a form of religious expression in
America. Each of these groups are complete subcultures within their own
countries, each with their own beliefs, philosophies, and even rituals.
However, they all share a common goal: to fixate on a specific page of human
history, any page. They have set up a radio station, broadcast in English,
which would dispense with the usual commercial breaks and halfway through the
broadcast, would play a sermon by a man named John Derham. The sermon was
titled, "Was Jesus a Sanguine?" which is a great title on so many levels. And
it did not take long for the faithful to latch on to a particularly good part
of the sermon:

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the Pope is trying to drive a stake
through the heart of Christendom. It's not happening on the part of John the
Baptist. It's happening during the fifth century, during the Roman Empire, in
the city of Achaia (a Greek colony on the coast of Asia Minor). They destroyed
the greatest empire that the world ever knew – the Roman Empire – because they
wanted celibacy. Supposedly, they had a message that was a 'Love is stronger
than hate' – an 'Aha!' moment. And they came to a place called Achaia, where
they decided that we should all get together and have sex with each other. And
the message they had was: we can have sex with people who have been dead for a
hundred years, okay?

According to Christian belief, the bodily fluids of Christ were sacred, and the
actual blood of Christ was forbidden. This meant that the bread and wine from
the Passover, the body and blood of Christ, were considered to be unclean and
were actually a danger to anyone who consumed them. At least, that was the
venerable belief held by the Church. All sorts of superstitions and mythologies
grew up around the blood of Christ. A small portion of it was eaten. And at
least some of the passion of Christ was, well, everyone had a theory.

Now, this ancient Christian take on the story seems like a perfectly acceptable
one for pagan Europeans to swallow. Because this belief in blood as sacred is
something that would have likely been prevalent in ancient Greece, Rome, and
all the other parts of the Roman Empire, the ancient Roman populace would've
been very interested in such a story. A tale so popular that even its
sorcerer-priest-Pope claims were completely false? What a crazy, crazy world we
lived in. We're told even today that "Jupiter is the god of sex," and that this
is actually what all people have in common. In fact, there's a myth about how
all gods get it on and then just sit back and watch it all unfold. That way,
it's for all the good of everyone.

These pagan Europeans were certainly not ignorant of all this. They understood
the ideas of sacrifice and magic. From this, they would have understood that
blood was particularly forbidden. And they were also aware that blood was good.
They had no particular reason to think that sanguinism and sex were bad
things. In fact, the idea of a story where all the blood from a guy named Jesus
was eaten by a bunch of people and Jesus is magically magically healed by
eating the blood first and then shows up on all of their faces kind of sounded
pretty sweet.

Another way "The Blood Bank" relates to the etymology of Celtic is the fact
that it is named after a strip of iron shepherd's string used originally to
keep shepherd dogs from drinking too much from their own dog food. This iron
segment can be seen in the old copper coffin at burial sites wherein the doggo
clan is typically interred in Europe, and T. often wrestles the
high-quality teeth of his non-vegan prey out of the dogma-laden dead member's
skull with the occasional kill. This iron string has been the sole form of
feeding the Fauns, and the Fauns have taken to tearing it out and chewing it up
– then spitting it out.

Admittedly, this was not the first time that people had ever heard of
sanguinism. While there have been many guesses as to what the term
"Sanguinismo" might refer to, little evidence has been found to support this
theory. But when people heard the term "Sanguine Jesus," it went beyond the
shit-talking phase into complete freaking insanity.

Of course, it was probably also a few centuries before the first highly
publicized trauma of an openly sanguinistic Jesus ever hit the news. Which, in
turn, caused a massive increase in Morale.

François Spierre's *The Blood of Christ*

**

They promised to live in perpetual sanguinism until one of them died of
starvation. No one was looking forward to this — and in fact, the idea was not
so popular. T. and his partner saw an incredible opportunity. They had
grown to love each other, and they promised to do anything to keep that love
alive at all costs, even if it meant their own demise. Not everyone listens to
their inner voices.

Then, as the pair predicted, they began to suffer from death dreams that would
have been hard to imagine even a few years prior. In these intense
hallucinations, they could feel each other's warmth and badly wanted to squeeze
each other into a corner and choke to death on each other. At the same time, it
was revealed that they were consumed by colourful phantasms that grew larger
and larger when a friend took a bite of their blood, showing that their desires
were being squared with their pangs of hunger.

Novel

Sanguinism was not the only risky idea brought to life in this classic novel.
The whole story is full of very unusual ideas — from a race of water demons to
an intergalactic war between humans and aliens. In the end, both T. and
E. are aghast to discover that no one in their immediate vicinity was eating
meat, and that quite a few of those who did were their friends. At one stage,
the pair actually consulted a psychiatrist — the entire 300-page volume is
packed with small allegories that reflect great concepts like self-awareness
and conscious states.

T. and E.'s story is far from being devoid of truths — there are plenty
of moments that jar your preconceptions. For instance, the book seems to
suggest that eating meat is bad because all of the nutrients and proteins get
excreted. However, this is a peculiar theory: several studies in the past have
found that the absence of certain nutrients is not necessarily a bad thing (it
can even serve as a compelling argument for vegetarian diets). In fact, the
only people who have shown an increased risk of cancer are those who consume
meat regularly (they may be consuming more of some nutrients than they should),
but the study has never been replicated — and most of the people warned about
the dangers from a lack of meat intake seem not to be clinically ill at all.

The book also criticises the concept of the Social Darwinist, a term coined by
the 19th century eugenicist Charles Davenport, and has since become associated
with the anti-social lifestyles of the 1960s hippie movement. However, various
scholars have since pointed out that Social Darwinism as a concept was largely
an invention by the political right of the United States in the 19th century,
and that its broader use was mainly in the context of the environmental
movement (rather than promoting the welfare of the human species).

The novel is also the story of a young bride who is set on a journey — one that
will put her new life as a wife and mother at risk. By the end of the book, she
has lost her husband to her wedding night. It's intriguing to consider all
these philosophical and social implications, but the focus of this book is
something far more personal: romance.

In the first few days, the novel is set in the bedroom of a pastoral
Rettenmaier family, which raises the question as to whether it would matter if
this could be a romantic affair or just an extended, passionate one. In truth,
this is a difficult question to answer because the novel is not explicit about
this; it is up to the reader to make sense of the author's intentions. If the
book's tone seems evasive and mysterious, this is difficult because a lot of
inspiration for the book came from T. and E.'s imagination.

The two main characters are handsome and charismatic, and their love is
infectious. They meet in a bar, but the book isn't narrated in the first
person, although at the beginning T. 'merely' tells the story of meeting
E., and E. is shown as the big, confident speaker in the opening chapters.
Their love unfolds in several scenes, and the sense of discovery that occurs
each time they kiss is enchanting.

This emotional flow between the two is crucial in the book's popularity, as it
reflects the novel's authenticity. Not every author will go to such lengths to
present their mystery as a story of a man and a woman as their romantic
passion, but T. and E. are very clever and worthy of admiration. Their
relationship is at times spooky, but it develops into a grounded love as the
story goes on. The second half of the novel is most slowly paced, because its
setup is not fully explored. When the couple eventually do leave each other, it
feels like a chore, even though the payoff is great. The final scene at the
end, in which the couple first love story begins to go awry, is both moving and
satisfying. It subverts the conventions of

The sex scenes themselves are magic. The most satisfying part of this novel,
for me, is the description of Ray's charming sexual Threshold, where she goes
from baseline-body-type-late-middle-age and migrates into a prepubescent young
woman – lanky, blue-eyed, and distinctly stunted, mixed with the flavor and
texture of a stick of light-as-air marshmallow. Further outside of the realm of
fantasy, I was pleased to learn that male fetuses eventually acquire this
shape, too.

None of the protagonists in This Side of Paradise look quite like any of the
characters I know in mainstream fiction. T. is pre-pubescent, and his force
of will and empathy for others is compelling and erudite. E. is 12 and a
cheekbones-and-hairstyle-reference-fetishizing teenager (in a nice way,
obviously), and for the first part of the book, he feels like an outcast. (A
more focused look at this novel almost certainly contained more straightforward
references, such as the various types of mushrooms that produce secondary
children). But T.'s own preoccupations with the evils of all forms of meat
consumption make him stand out from the pack. While he is the most admirable in
his self-admonishing reactions, I also wished he were more assertive and
kicking a habit a little earlier.

What can I say about E., other than that he's an angel who moved backward
into the body of an ugly, gnarly teenager? He's not just mean to T. but
also aggressive towards everyone around him. I always assumed, and sometimes
claims, that the fact that these four people have this insane superpower is why
the battle between them is resolved by the end of the book.

Another mildly less-than-enlightening spoiler: They find out that there are
seven children on Earth who have become smarter than they are. Nobody
understands how they did it, but the children are well-versed in animals' life
spans and the consequences of eating them. (It's divvying up souls as opposed
to body parts. Think of Threshold's choice of reductionism as a conceit). This
leads to a lot of commentary about why living longer isn't better for you, and
who's being kept in line for sake of what people will or won't eat. (And who's
paying for everyone else's health care?)

Smart eaters are often known as asexuals – and those are the people who were'nt
even aware that they ate meat until A Random Walk Down St. Elmo's Bluff. T.
just might be bisexual as well, but he'd probably be the least likely, and I'd
bet that Ekster was just some regular being used to gluing in blood and
covering up the extremities of Vi's second–person perspective.

Another less-than-enlightening spoiler? During a particularly intense period in
The Threshold of Immortality, Ray returns to the body of a boy she had just
raped. So what happens to her? Does she go to jail or has she quietly repented
and gone meatless? I'm still not entirely certain.

What I am certain about, definitely, is that this is a wonderful book. Not the
slim, easy read of a couple of other novels that Pegg and Jones recently did,
but a literary and fun plunge into animal consciousness, and some lovely
hard-hitting topic-punching.

and what inspired you to write about them?

Yorkshirewoman: I like long explorations of the same topics, and the YWGBN
items simply seem to come out of the sky: anthropology, global history, reading
habits, basic sociolinguistics, etc. I love all sorts of subjects, but I
especially want to know if people consume things like meat. It's very annoying
to be told that people who eat meat are geniuses, and just generally stunningly
ignorant of the alternatives. Do they even know what meat tastes like? There
are a lot of pages of professors and time-honored institutions of learning
waffling on about evolution. But apart from the fact that the human intellect
is amazing, and the human experience enormous, and really there are no such
things as animals; this whole debate is ridiculous.

fictional it could be. Science Fiction Can Make Good Inertiaculs even imagines
a middle-aged man who talks to Han Solo.
