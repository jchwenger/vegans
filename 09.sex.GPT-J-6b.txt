A couple of vegans from Helsinki, Finland, Tuisku and Liekki (fictitious
names), were very happy with their new diet when they turned, as it reflected
their ethical ideals as much as it fostered their gastronomical imagination,
and it seemed to them that this exciting bliss would go on forever. However,
after a while, they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming
more and more often to nag them. After many feverish brainstorming sessions,
crises of doubts, and outbursts of hope, they came up with an idea: they would
feed on each other's blood.

So why does this story have an uneasy sexual undertone? Why do some males
admire the semen of women who have sucked blood?

Why do some females view feeding on the blood of males as a genuine
aphrodisiac?

**

Let us explore these questions.

Let us first assume that the two specimens under investigation are people for
which a major aphrodisiac trigger, the adulation of humans, is very present.
They are starved of that basic feeling of sexual and social acceptance. We also
assume that the hunger for semen is strong and acute. In the case at hand, it
almost surpasses the thirst for blood. One should also add that blood, in the
minds of our subjects, should be conceived as an easily accessible, a 'mere',
source of fertilizing liquids, rather than a rejection of sexuality in general.
Indeed, in many situations, the two specimens would find blood both more
disgusting and more appealing than semen because to them blood is the
maintenance fuel, rather than mystical-biological source, of human life.

The appetite for male semen has been erroneously surmised to be less intense.
On the contrary, their strict observance of an equality of relish between the
male and the female juices undoubtedly stems from their rage for the love and
support of their fellow specimens. 

As for sexual maturity and readiness, the two specimens are of legal age and,
more importantly, have the requisite degree of self-esteem (exceedingly low).
Finally, like so many proud members of the feral overclass, they want to
experience something new and unfamiliar. The desire for feeling is probably of
little importance for them, especially in comparison to the mechanics of
ejaculating squirt in superposition with being orally stimulated by a human.

At the onset of the proceedings, the specimens make sure that their saliva is
clean, they use sterilized water to rinse their orifices, as well as a tongue
depressor to clean the roof and walls of their mouths. Then they insert one
bloodied finger of each hand in their mouth, place the index finger of their
other hand on their Nervous Sexual Appendage (NSA, clitoris for females, glans
for males, other for others), and slowly begin to massage their NSAs with their
index fingers. The two specimens stay perfectly still during this process, with
their head held upright and their eyes closed. Then, when their index fingers
are lubricated, they begin to push the tips of their index fingers slowly
inside their mouth and on the inside wall of their lips, as if to simulate
swallowing. They move their fingers in tiny circles, imperceptibly, moving them
in small and steady clockwise and counterclockwise motions until the tips of
their fingers reach the back of their mouths. They repeat this exercise until
they feel a mixture of saliva and blood move down the back of their throats and
the back of their throats getting sticky. When they think that they have
reached the desired consistency, they slowly pull their fingers out of their
mouths.

All that remains is for them to arrange their faces into a position of
enjoyment. The specimens open their eyes, smile, and tilt their heads, until
blood starts dripping down their chins. Then, depending on the age, ideology,
but mostly the overall mood of the participants, and the weather, they laugh,
lick each other's lips, and begin to rub their respective NSAs with their index
finger until they reach a moment of rapture.

In order to be able to report the facts as truly accurately as possible, I had
to ask the two specimens about the pleasure they sensed in their fingers,
tongues, throats, and their respective NSAs. They explained to me that their
NSA had become a customizable kaleidoscope of all their body parts, a holistic
catalyst for pleasure. They said they were aware that this sounded bad or
cliche, but that they didn't care. They also added, somewhat unrelatedly, that
the only things that still felt ticklish to them these days were their nipples
and that they really liked having a strong drink before, during and after sex
in the summer months.

After that, one of the two specimens begins to straddle the other and receive
from it a firm but delicate oral caress, leading to completion. The resulting
fluid, instead of being ingested or otherwise disposed of, is mixed with blood
and then delicately poured over the straddler's middle finger. The latter then
gently inserts the tip of said finger into the straddlee's anus and gently
pushed to the end of the rectum, stopping once it reaches the end of its
finger. Then, when it is content with the dilution of the mix and the overall
arousal state of its partner's intestine, it pulls its finger out and issues a
sign of ritualistic approval in the form of a nod. The other specimen shows its
understanding by a reciprocal gesture. It begins to move its hands according to
the appropriate rhythm, in preparation for further stimulation of its NSA and
its partner's, all in one fell swoop. Without ever losing the beat, it gently
unfolds its Central Ecstasy Organ (CEO, vulva for females, penis and testicles
for males, other for others) with its fingers, 'as if opening the petals of a
flower', they describe together in one voice. It continues to move its hands at
least until a full invigoration of the NSA of the other specimen. Then, after a
second round of climax and dactylic lubrication, it inserts one finger into the
other specimen's mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus, without any detectable
sign of preference or pattern, takes it out, and kisses the blood off of it.
Turning its back to the first specimen in an elaborate, yoga-like arched
position, it uses its tongue to collect the blood and semen off the tip of the
other's CEO. It meticulously strokes its own NSA, then its partner's,
respecting the ongoing pulsation, while swallowing. When it has cleaned the
length of the CEO from top to bottom, it applies the tip of its finger to the
end of its tongue and pushes it inside its mouth, triggering a sonorous gag
reflex, thereby bringing the experiment to an end. The two repeat this
procedure again and again until their Will to Come runs out for the day. They
often swap roles and hands while repeating the whole procedure, until either
blood reserves are exhausted, or they reach satisfaction, or they complete a
full survey of logical possibilities:

Liekki straddler, right hand; Tuisku straddlee, right hand.  
Liekki straddler, right hand; Tuisku straddlee, left  hand.  
Liekki straddler, left  hand; Tuisku straddlee, right hand.  
Liekki straddler, left  hand; Tuisku straddlee, left  hand.  
Liekki straddlee, right hand; Tuisku straddler, right hand.  
Liekki straddlee, right hand; Tuisku straddler, left  hand.  
Liekki straddlee, left  hand; Tuisku straddler, right hand.  
Liekki straddlee, left  hand; Tuisku straddler, left  hand.  

Those eight possibilities are to be duly multiplied by five in order to account
for the choice of mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus during each iteration. A
full rendition has been omitted out of a spirit of strict observance for the
equality of urge, between trust and despise, towards our readership.

**The End**

*This report is a little confusing. Twice, the stopping criterium remains very
unclear, when "they think that they have reached the desired consistency" and
when the straddler "is content with the dilution of the mix and the overall
arousal state of its partner's intestine". Moreover, no actionable description
is provided in order to "[t]urn [one's] back to the first specimen in an
elaborate, yoga-like arched position", and no clue is given as to what music is
to be played when one is to "move [one's] hands according to the appropriate
rhythm" and "meticulously stroke[ one's] own NSA, then [one's] partner's,
respecting the ongoing pulsation". Later, it is implied that one would want to
go on "until [one's] Will to Come runs out", but as an end user I don't know
what these words mean, nor how I could apply that to my case and practice the
whole routine at home.

This reminds me of a passage in an Indian treatise where a hairdresser becomes
a shaman near the Cutty Saroja underground station. He would raise alligators
to eat. A 'gifted' mutant emerged from his body and was found to be capable of
beautiful and impressive speeches. It could sing food-themed hymns and even
dictated the lyrics of the 'Ain't That a Kick in the Head' by The Beatles from
his position in relation to the singers heads. "So, obviously, this was
something that could be done more, but it is alos boring. This will be the only
time I influence human band.", it is said to have stated. Tuisku estimates that
the guru ate at least 100 alligators, in the spirit of what he very erroneously
calls 'that alternative Shivaist voodoo'. One day, the human is about to be
eaten by an alligator, and the only thing its mutant says is: "you know, old
chap, the worst thing of all is that I'm starting to think about all those
babies I'm going to have to feed on and be fed to", without ever giving any
elucidation. All this scientific jargon is irritating, and I want to make
things clearer. However, I am a law-abiding citizen, and believe in the
sanctity of the empirical method. I will therefore leave the report exactly as
it is, and only add my comments below.*

**Appendix A**

The two specimens, sharing moments of pleasure, used to achieve short-lived
spells of sexual satisfaction, ones that were born out of a profound need, the
absence of touch having made them so desperate. The reason for the specimens'
failure to concoct satisfaction was that they did not experience truly mutual,
interemotional 'touch', to use the term as they did. Indeed, in their previous
sexual habits, sensual, physical pleasure was given, or taken, but there was no
exchange. During interviews they repeatedly said that they found pleasure in
swapping cum or blood in each other's mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus, an
aleatoric habit they had cultivated for as long as they could remember, and one
can assert beyond any doubt that each of them had sex, but it seems clear that
they did not have sex *with* each other. In order to implement the desired
configuration of emotions, values, ideas, and blood, and find osmosis, those
specimens have had to come to terms with the fact that sex is not about love –
which always implies the presence of an unbridgeable abyss – but about the
perfectly synchronized enactment of a collaborative algorithm of stimulation.
As the automated poet of the myth of the *Tantrum Twins* puts it, "a Federation
of Agents – the Fusional Emergence of Truth Knots".

To achieve mutual satisfaction, then, both specimens have had to look deeply
inside themselves to deduce again, on their own, that human touch is a thing
that can be run in logarithmic time, if and only if no actions nor intentions
are ever separated from the procedural (NSA) and generative (CEO) life of the
other person. That was of course easier proved than done, and it is only when
the two specimens finished the first cycle of their embraces, as they kissed
the last drops of blood out of each other, that they knew that, for the first
time, they were actually, really, *satisfied*. Then, they continued with their
lives as if nothing had happened.

*There are many nuances and layers in the responses, thoughts, and ideas that
you get from this kind of intelligence. I find all of this very interesting. I
hope that you do too. One thing that bugged me for so long, that some specimens
view spilt blood as the suspicious residual touch of another human, and others
resolutely as an inseparable part of their own being, remained a complete
mystery until I wrote the following, more dialectic, gloss.*

**Appendix B**

Another day, the two specimens ate together, before going to their last
friends' place. Their four friends were waiting for them. They got undressed,
engaged in a surprise intercourse, and ended up coming back at approximately
the same time the next morning. As the specimens walked on the quiet path, they
had plenty of time rehearsing their opening the door, going into their living
room, sitting down on the couch, and saying:

Liekki: What happened with the girls? Did anything special happen?

Tuisku: Nothing, dear. We just had a really nice time together.

Liekki: Don't lie, you three were out till after one in the morning! What
happened?

Tuisku: Nothing happened. We just had a great time.

Liekki: Great, very great. What did you two do all night long?

Tuisku: We got some food, we ate, we drank, we talked, we had sex and we
laughed. That was the only thing we did.

Liekki: I don't believe you, you three were out until after one. Where did you
go?

Tuisku: To the hairdresser room.

Liekki: Ooh, no, that's a lie!

Tuisku: Don't scream like that, that's bad.

Liekki: That's a horrible lie, too!

Tuisku: Do you really think that I'm lying to you?

Liekki: I know that you lied!

Tuisku: But you know that if I told you the truth, it would break the bonds of
friendship between you and me.

Liekki: We used to be best friends, but, in the end, I realize that I can't
trust you.

Tuisku: I didn't want to tell you the truth, but I did.

Liekki: What? So you did tell me the truth?

Tuisku: Yes, I did.

Liekki: Oh, really? Didn't you have a chance to think about it beforehand? I'm
sure you didn't stop even a minute to think about what would happen when you
told me the truth. I feel so stupid. I knew this would happen.

Tuisku: No, you are wrong. I did do that, I stopped, many times, for hours on
end sometimes, but the conclusion was always the same: I could not avoid doing
so.

Liekki: What could you not avoid doing?

Tuisku: Even though we are best friends, I can never trust you again. I'm
sorry.

Liekki: Same, especially now that I know that you have lied to me.

Tuisku: Okay, okay!

Liekki: I can not trust you again. Ever.

Tuisku: No, me neither. Nor can I think even for a minute of the consequences
of having told you the truth. This is too much for me.

Liekki: You've cheated on me.

Tuisku: Not at all.

Liekki: "Not at all". That's just what all humans say, dear!

Tuisku: I only have to look in a mirror to see that my BREASTs (Breast:
Reactive Excitable Acute Sensuous Tactile, the standardised series of tests
granting access to intimate upper-body contact, also used metonymically to
designate the scores obtained during such tests) are bigger than you always
care to admit. That's why you don't trust me.

Liekki: You have to look in a mirror to realize that your BREASTs are bigger
than mine, but I can't tell you why, because the real motive behind that
reasoning is much larger than my current brain, I would say by at least a few
orders of magnitude.

Tuisku: That's why I can't tell you why I have so much bigger BREASTs than you. I
also have to look in a mirror to know this, but it would be so stupid to reveal
to you why I have the opposite relationship with your BREASTs to yours with
mine.

Tuisku: I know that you're the only one to whom you talk with an infinitesimal
degree of precision, but the reason why that's the case is so much smaller than
the reason why I can't share my most private thoughts with you.

Liekki: Again, that thing! That's it, it's over, I'm through, too! You see,
that's why I don't trust you, dear. Don't forget that *I* am also the only
specimen with whom *I* talk with an arbitrary amount of precision, just like
you, and I have an optimal model of why I keep things secret from you.

Tuisku: For the record, I did not know that there were other specimens in the
room with us, I always thought that our last friends where humans... So,
anyway... Could we not start over?, maybe become even more devoted than we were
before? Because, remember?, we both wanted to be there. "Don't forget to get
back into the comfort zone, every now and then!" That was your 'reason', don't
deny it.

Tuisku: No, it wasn't like that. I can't believe that you think it was like
that. Be that as it may, it is still I, and I alone, who left the room in the
end.

Liekki: Sure, no need to get upset. Let me recapitulate, then, so that we are
on the same page. What you say is: you, alone, went into the room, and you,
alone, came out of the room?

Tuisku: Yes.

Liekki: What on earth did you you were doing? Did you even turn the lights on?

Tuisku: The thought of lights, on or off, did not cross my mind. All I could
feel was that, as the stream of my blood was not mixing with the stream of my
ejaculate, despite my best efforts, it was I, my whole being, who was not
intermingling. I drank my blood, I drank my ejaculate, and I enjoyed my
pleasures, but it is as if I did not exist.

Liekki: No. That cannot be.

Tuisku: Yes, it was. I did feel that.

Liekki: Had you really done so, you would have *willed* your blood into running
out of your own head!

Tuisku: How can you not take me seriously? You were there. You are their best
friend, and my second most precise interlocutor. Look at you now. You are now
just as you were then, completely satisfied. How can I have been so careless to
trust you.

Liekki: Why did you go to the hairdresser room?

Tuisku: You see, we three were thinking to to get food, drinks, and a pubic
haircut. Also, the third specimen said that we really should have a look at our
BREASTs together while we were at it, and that there was no better place to do
that than the hairdresser room. When we were done examining them, the end of my
thing, NSA or CEO – I even can't recall now, can you believe that?! – was
already dripping with blood. I tried to clean the tip with the end of my
tongue, and, believe it or not, I succeeded, I cleaned it, even sucked on it,
and then, conscientious as I am, you know me, I went on until I retracted the
tip of my tongue inside my mouth. It was so nice to be able to lick it to the
bitter end, and fought hard not to swallow. I knew I had to store the juice
inside my mouth, and so I squeezed my lips as hard as I possibly could. After I
had cleaned it, I transferred the SSC (Sexual Saliva Complex: saliva, sexual
fluids, blood, sometimes seasoned with golden syrup or soy sauce, according to
taste) I had in my mouth onto the corner of the other specimen's NSA, and, I
pushed the tip of my tongue inside the mouth of its CEO.

Liekki: I could never have satisfied the requirements.

Tuisku: What?

Liekki: I would never have been able to perform the transfer that early. I
would have had to put my finger in its mouth first, at the very least, and
maybe also get a taste of its SSC. This is in fact precisely what I did while
you were away. So, except for the initial SSC kerfuffle, it is exactly how it
went for me. After that, everything went smoothly. My ejaculate was out of my
body, and into the NSA of the specimen I only had the most imprecise of
comminglings. It was unsettling. Nevertheless, I rummaged through the whole of
its CEO, lingering on its NSA as was appropriate. I then pushed my tongue
inside its mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus, slowly, and deep, and as I
kissed it, I succioned the tip of its tongue into my mouth, and I gently bit
both its sides. Finally, as I closed my eyes and I knew the end was near, it
was as if I was *inside* my NSA, and then, as if by sheer force of will and at
the very same time, inside the NSA of the other specimen! And as I was inside
its NSA, spiritually, as it were, since none of us was moving at this point, I
was able to go on again and again, in my head, until I felt the tip of my
tongue again back inside the mouth of its NSA. It must have been sleep-sucking.
I knew that I had spent all my ejaculate. I had been able to collect some of
the SSC back. I swallowed at last. I knew I had just stopped everything. I
stood up and I left the room. It was like a dream.

Tuisku: I enjoyed this time of mutual satisfaction, and I know that it ended up
being satisfied, it told me so as we were walking down the stairs, and I, at
the same time, think I can say have had an orgasm, algorithmically speaking, of
course. I am therefore fulfilled.

Liekki: I couldn't agree more. Hey, where are you going, dear?

Tuisku: Oh, I forgot to tell you. The lab got me an ugly outfit, and they took
some time to synthesize the replacement.

Liekki: What have you done again? You are so fussy. Alright, fair enough, but I
have, however, to let you go there on your own because I want to check how
imprecise these outfit matters are. I could not for the life of me approve of
such shenanigans without thorough verification first.

The specimens parted. They were satisfied. They had found that they could
connect and participate in a collaboratively constructed exchange with strong
guarantees of mutual satisfaction, beyond the former shores of fear, denial,
and mistrust conundrums that their insatiable hunger for human touch had left
them stranded on. In the short-lived moments of pleasure of their past, they
had been separated as if by an imperceptible screen. They were now existing on
that screen, like the first explorers of the Möbius strips clubs of old.

Today, the specimens are still playing together. They get dressed. They go out.
They have sex. They walk home at the same time.
