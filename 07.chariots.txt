### 7.

Everyone was horrified, but they had both fallen in love with this idea,
forgetting all consequences. And so it came to pass that they put everyone to
one side, and themselves to the other. They became hungrier than ever, and they
managed to keep each other alive for several weeks, their mutual memory banks
full of the horrific pasts of the other. Then they changed their minds: given
who they had become, it did not really matter whether they got along with
everyone or not. They felt other and the same. Blood had made them multiple,
parallel and indifferent. They spent their time devising speed buying routines,
methodically testing them when at the grocery store. When in public, they often
pelted each other with quick-fire *jeux d'esprit* written in foreign languages,
like normal people do. They found that they had become able to resist all
temptations. During their meals, they would invent jokes about last suppers,
about going crazy, about stabbing each other, about shearing off livers and
pancreases, prostates and fallopian tubes. Sipping on delicious cocktails, they
shared plans to elope into the sky on radiant chariots.
