Why does this story have an uneasy sexual undertone?

Why do some males admire the semen of women who have sucked blood?

Why do some females view feeding on blood-drenched male organs as a genuine
aphrodisiac?

Let us explore these questions.

Let us first assume that the two specimens under investigation are people in
whom the adulation of humans, a major aphrodisiac trigger, is very present.
They are starved of that basic feeling of sexual and social acceptance. We also
assume that their hunger for semen is strong and acute. In the case at hand, it
almost surpasses the thirst for blood. One should also add that blood, in the
minds of our subjects, should be conceived as an easily accessible, a 'mere'
source of ichor, and is in no way associated with a rejection of
fertilisability or sexuality in general. Indeed, in many situations, the two
specimens would find blood both more disgusting and more appealing than semen
because to them blood is the maintenance fuel, rather than mystical-biological
source, of human life.

The appetite for male semen has been erroneously surmised to be less intense
than for the female one in our subjects. On the contrary, their strict
observance of an equality of relish between the male and the female juices
undoubtedly stems from a savage love and support for their fellow specimens. 

As for sexual maturity and readiness, the two specimens are of legal age and,
more importantly, have the required degree of self-esteem (exceedingly low).
Finally, like so many proud members of the feral overclass, they want to
experience something new and unfamiliar. The desire for feelings is probably of
little importance to them, especially in comparison to the nonlinear mechanics
of ejaculation, the quantum superposition of squirts, or even the algebraic
topology of human oral stimulation.

At the onset of the proceedings, the specimens make sure that their saliva is
clean, they use sterilised water to rinse their orifices, as well as a tongue
depressor to clean the roof and walls of their mouths. Then they insert one
bloodied finger of each hand in their mouth, place the index finger of their
other hand on their Nervous Sexual Appendage (NSA, clitoris for females, glans
for males, other for others), and slowly begin to massage their NSAs with their
index fingers. The two specimens stay perfectly still during this process, with
their head held upright and their eyes closed. Then, when their index fingers
are lubricated, they begin to push the tips of their index fingers slowly
inside their mouth and on the inside wall of their lips, as if to simulate
swallowing. They move their fingers in tiny circles, imperceptibly, moving them
in small and steady clockwise and counterclockwise motions until the tips of
their fingers reach the back of their mouths. They repeat this exercise until
they feel the mixture of saliva and blood move down the back of their throats,
and the back of their throats consequently getting sticky. When they think that
they have reached the desired consistency, they slowly pull their fingers out
of their mouths.

All that remains is for them to arrange their faces into a position of
enjoyment. The specimens open their eyes, smile, and tilt their heads, until
blood starts dripping down their chins. Then, depending on the age, ideology,
but mostly the overall mood of the participants, and the weather, they laugh,
lick each other's lips, or begin to rub their respective NSAs with their index
finger until they reach a moment of rapture.

In order to be able to report the facts as truly and accurately as possible, I
had to ask the two specimens about the pleasure they sensed in their fingers,
tongues, throats, and respective NSAs. They explained to me that their NSA had
become a customizable kaleidoscope of all their body parts, a holistic catalyst
for pleasure. They said they were aware that this sounded bad or cliché, but
that they didn't care. They also added, somewhat unrelatedly, that the only
things that still felt ticklish to them these days were their nipples and that
they really liked having a strong drink before, during and after sex in the
summer months.

After that, one of the two specimens begins to straddle the other and receive
from it a firm but delicate oral caress, leading to completion. The resulting
fluid, instead of being ingested or otherwise disposed of, is mixed with blood
and then delicately poured over the straddler's middle finger. The latter then
gently inserts the tip of said finger into the straddlee's anus and just as
gently pushes it into the rectum, stopping once it reaches the end of its
finger. Then, when it is content with the dilution of the mix and the overall
arousal state of its partner's intestine, it pulls its finger out and issues a
sign of ritualistic approval in the form of a nod. The other specimen shows its
understanding by a reciprocal gesture. It begins to move its hands according to
the appropriate rhythm, in preparation for further stimulation of its NSA and
its partner's, all in one fell swoop. Without ever losing the beat, it gently
unfolds its Central Ecstasy Organ (CEO, vulva for females, penis and testicles
for males, other for others) with its fingers, 'as if opening the petals of a
flower', they describe together in one voice. It continues to move its hands at
least until a full invigoration of the NSA of the other specimen. Then, after a
second round of climax and dactylic lubrication, it inserts one finger into the
other specimen's mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus, without any detectable
sign of preference or pattern, takes it out, and kisses the blood off of it.
Turning its back to the first specimen in an elaborate, yoga-like arched
position, it uses its tongue to collect the blood and semen off the tip of the
other's CEO. It meticulously strokes its own NSA, then its partner's,
respecting the ongoing pulsation, swallowing all the while. When it has cleaned
the length of the CEO from top to bottom, it applies the tip of its finger to
the end of its tongue and pushes it inside its mouth, triggering a sonorous gag
reflex, thereby bringing the experiment to an end.

The specimens repeat this procedure again and again until their Will to Come
runs out for the day. They often swap roles and hands while repeating the whole
procedure, until either blood reserves are exhausted, or they reach
satisfaction, or they complete a full survey of logical possibilities:

Liekki straddler, right hand; Tuisku straddlee, right hand.  
Liekki straddler, right hand; Tuisku straddlee, left  hand.  
Liekki straddler, left  hand; Tuisku straddlee, right hand.  
Liekki straddler, left  hand; Tuisku straddlee, left  hand.  
Liekki straddlee, right hand; Tuisku straddler, right hand.  
Liekki straddlee, right hand; Tuisku straddler, left  hand.  
Liekki straddlee, left  hand; Tuisku straddler, right hand.  
Liekki straddlee, left  hand; Tuisku straddler, left  hand.  

Those eight possibilities are to be duly multiplied by five in order to account
for the choice of mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus during each iteration. A
full rendition has been omitted out of a spirit of strict observance for the
equality of urge, between trust and despise, towards our readership.

**The End**

*This report is a little confusing. Twice, the stopping criterium remains very
unclear, when "they think that they have reached the desired consistency" and
when the straddler "is content with the dilution of the mix and the overall
arousal state of its partner's intestine". Moreover, no actionable description
is provided in order to "[t]urn [one's] back to the first specimen in an
elaborate, yoga-like arched position", and no clue is given as to what music is
to be played when one is to "move [one's] hands according to the appropriate
rhythm" and "meticulously stroke[ one's] own NSA, then [one's] partner's,
respecting the ongoing pulsation". Later on, it is implied that one would want
to go on "until [one's] Will to Come runs out", but as an end user I don't know
what these words mean, how do I know if I even have any Will to Come or when it
may come to exhaustion. I really am left wondering how on Earth I could apply
that to my case and practice the whole routine at home, which is a shame, as it
otherwise sounds great. I very much hope the author will soon open a helpline
or allow fans to pay for additional support.*

*As an aside, this reminds me of a passage in an Indian treatise where a
hairdresser becomes a shaman near the Cutty Saroja underground station. He
would raise alligators to eat. One day, a 'gifted' mutant emerges from his body
and is found to be capable of beautiful and impressive speeches. It can sing
food-themed hymns and even dictates the lyrics of 'Ain't That a Kick in the
Head' to The Beatles from his position of power above the musicians' heads as
they are immobilised during a haircut. "So, obviously, this is something that
could be done more, but it is also boring. This will be the only time I
influence a human band.", it is said to have stated. Tuisku, the urban poet and
undercover statistician who first recited these rigorous verses, estimates that
the one he wrongly calls a guru ate at least 100 alligators in total since the
mutant arose, and remains fascinated by the boldness of what he very
erroneously, and in fact frankly offensively labels 'that alternative Shivaist
voodoo'. Another day, the hairdresser is about to be eaten by his lunch –
always an alligator – and the only thing the mutant says is: "you know, old
chap, the worst thing of all is that I'm starting to think about all those
babies I'm going to have to feed on and be fed to once you get digested",
without ever giving any elucidation. He did have a big poster of downtown San
Antonio in his bedroom, though.

In any case, as a conclusion to my review, I can say that I find all this
scientific jargon irritating, and I want the author to make things clearer.
However, I am a law-abiding citizen, and believe in the sanctity of the
empirical method. I will therefore leave the report exactly as it is, and only
add my comments below.*

**Appendix A**

The two specimens, sharing moments of pleasure, used to achieve short-lived
spells of sexual satisfaction, ones that were born out of a profound need, the
absence of touch having made them so desperate. The reason for the specimens'
failure to concoct satisfaction was that they did not experience truly mutual,
interemotional 'touch', to use the term as they did. Indeed, in their previous
sexual habits, sensual, physical pleasure was given, or taken, but there was no
exchange. During interviews they repeatedly said that they found pleasure in
swapping cum or blood in each other's mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus, an
aleatoric habit they had cultivated for as long as they could remember, and one
can assert beyond any doubt that each of them had sex, but it seems just as
clear that they did not have sex *with* each other. In order to implement the
desired configuration of emotions, values, ideas, and blood, and find osmosis,
those specimens have had to come to terms with the fact that sex is not about
love – which always implies the presence of an unbridgeable abyss – but about
the perfectly synchronised enactment of a collaborative algorithm of
stimulation. As the automated poet of the myth of the *Tantrum Twins* puts it,
"a Federation of Agents – the Fusional Emergence of Truth Knots".

To achieve mutual satisfaction, then, both specimens have had to look deeply
inside themselves to deduce again, on their own, that human touch is a thing
that can be run in logarithmic time, if and only if no actions nor intentions
are ever separated from the procedural (NSA) and generative (CEO) life of the
other person. That was of course easier proved than done, and it is only when
the two specimens finished the first cycle of their embraces, as they kissed
the last drops of blood out of each other, that they knew that, for the first
time, they were actually, truly, deeply, *satisfied*. Then, they continued with
their lives as if nothing had happened.

*There are many nuances and layers in the responses, thoughts, and ideas that
you get from this kind of intelligence. I find all of this very interesting. I
hope that you do, too. One thing that bugged me for so long, however, is that
some specimens view spilt blood as the suspicious residual touch of another
human – gross! –, whereas others resolutely as an inseparable part of their own
being. How such divergence can even exist remained a complete mystery until I
wrote the following, more dialectic, gloss.*

**Appendix B**

Another day, the two specimens ate together, before going to their last
friends' place. Their four friends were waiting for them. They got undressed,
engaged in a surprise intercourse, and ended up coming back at approximately
the same time the next morning. As the specimens walked on the quiet path, they
had plenty of time rehearsing opening the door, going into their living room,
sitting down on the couch, and arguing:

Liekki: What happened with the friends? No. Did anything special happen with
the friends? You disappeared for half the night.

Tuisku: Nothing, dear. We just had a really nice time together.

Liekki: Don't lie, you three were out till after one in the morning! What
happened?

Tuisku: Nothing happened. We just had a great time, the two of us.

Liekki: Great, very great. What did you two do all night long?

Tuisku: We got some food, we ate, we drank, we talked, we had sex and we
laughed. That was the only thing we did. We were six, by the way, you included.

Liekki: I don't believe you, you four were out until after one. Where did you
go?

Tuisku: To the hairdresser room.

Liekki: Ooh, no, that's a lie!

Tuisku: Don't scream like that, that's bad.

Liekki: That's a horrible lie, too! Screaming has therapeutic virtues!

Tuisku: Do you really think that I'm lying to you?

Liekki: I know that you lied!

Tuisku: But you know that if I told you the truth, it would break the bonds of
friendship between you and me.

Liekki: Whatever. We used to be best friends, you know, but, in the end, I
realise that I can't trust you.

Tuisku: I didn't want to tell you the truth, but I did.

Liekki: What? So you did tell me the truth?

Tuisku: Yes! Who do you think I am? Of course I did.

Liekki: Oh, really? Didn't you have a chance to tell me all about it
beforehand? I'm sure you didn't stop even a minute to think about what would
happen when you didn't tell me you told me the truth. I feel so stupid. I knew
this would happen.

Tuisku: No, you are wrong. I did do that, I stopped to doubt myself, then went
back to doing it, many times, for hours on end sometimes, but the conclusion
was always the same: I could not avoid doing so.

Liekki: What could you not avoid doing?

Tuisku: Telling you the truth. Even though we are best friends, I can never
trust you again. I'm sorry.

Liekki: Same here, especially now that I know that you have lied to me.

Tuisku: Okay, okay!

Liekki: I can not trust you again. Ever.

Tuisku: No, me neither. Nor can I think even for a minute of the consequences
of having told you the truth. This is too much for me.

Liekki: You've cheated on me.

Tuisku: Not at all.

Liekki: "Not at all"... That's just what all humans say, dear!

Tuisku: I only have to look in a mirror to see that my BREASTs (BREAST:
Reactive Excitable Acute Sensuous Tactile, a recursive acronym for the
standardised series of tests granting access to intimate upper-body contact,
also used metonymically to designate the scores obtained during such tests) are
bigger than you always care to admit. That's why you don't trust me.

Liekki: You can have a look in a mirror and tell yourself you realise that your
BREASTs are bigger than mine all you want, that won't change the fact that I
can't tell you why you are wrong even if you are wrong, because the stupidity
of the real motive behind that vague reasoning of yours is much more
unbrearable than my current brain is willing to tolerate, I would say by at
least a few orders of magnitude, which leaves me equally speechless and
unconvinced.

Tuisku: That's why I can't tell you *why* I have so much bigger BREASTs than
you. You can't even begin to fathom how humiliating it is to me that I have to
look in a mirror to know this. You've always ever known but clarity and purpose
in life. Anyway, now I feel so stupid for wanting to reveal to you why I have
the opposite relationship with your BREASTs to yours with mine.

Liekki: I'm not even going to answer that. There's more to life than marks and
exams.

Tuisku: I know that these fucking BREASTs are the only reason why you talk with
an infinitesimal degree of precision, but the reason why that's the case is so
much smaller than the reason why I can't share my most private thoughts with
you. I think we should focus on that instead, I'm through with this bullshit.

Liekki: Again, that thing! That's it, it's over, daddy, I'm through, too! You
see, that's why I don't trust you, dear. Don't forget that *I* am also the only
specimen with whom *I* talk with an arbitrary amount of precision, just like
you, and I have an optimal model of why I keep things secret from you.

Tuisku: Right. For the record, last night, I did not know that there were other
specimens in the room with us, OK? I always thought that our last friends where
humans... Anyway... Could we not start over?, maybe become even more devoted
than we were before? Because, remember?, we both wanted to be there. "Don't
forget to get back into the comfort zone, every now and then!" That was your
'reason' to go, don't deny it!

Liekki: No, it wasn't like that. I can't believe that you think it was like
that. Be that as it may, it is still I, and I alone, who left the room in the
end.

Tuisku: Yes, yes, I don't deny that, no need to get upset. Let me recapitulate,
then, so that we are on the same page. What you say is: you, alone, went into
the room, and you, alone, came out of the room?

Liekki: You are so irritating! Now I almost feel like agreeing. Anyway, what on
Earth did you think you were doing? And by that I mean, before and after I was
in the room. Did you even turn the lights on?

Tuisku: The thought of lights, on or off, did not cross my mind. All I could
feel was that, as the stream of my blood was not mixing with the stream of my
ejaculate, despite my best efforts, it was I, my whole being, who was not
intermingling. I drank my blood, I drank my ejaculate, and I enjoyed my
pleasures, but it is as if I did not exist.

Liekki: No. That cannot be.

Tuisku: Yes, it was. I did feel that.

Liekki: Had you really done so, you would have *willed* your blood into running
out of your own head, leading to an unmistakable perception of existence!

Tuisku: How can you not take me seriously? You were there! You are their best
friend, and my second most precise interlocutor. Look at you now. You are now
just as you were then, completely satisfied. How can I have been so careless to
trust you.

Liekki: Why did you go to the hairdresser room?

Tuisku: You see, we three were thinking to to get food, drinks, and a pubic
haircut. Also, the third friend said that we really should have a look at our
BREASTs together while we were at it, and that there was no better place to do
that than the hairdresser room. When we were done examining them, the end of my
thing, NSA or CEO – I even can't recall now, can you believe that?! – was
already dripping with blood. I tried to clean the tip of it with the end of my
tongue, and, believe it or not, I succeeded, I cleaned it, even sucked on it,
and then, conscientious as I am, you know me, I went on until I retracted the
tip of my tongue inside my mouth. It was so nice to be able to lick it to the
bitter end, and fought hard not to swallow. I knew I had to store the juice
inside my mouth, and so I squeezed my lips as hard as I possibly could. After I
had cleaned it, I transferred the SSC (Sexual Saliva Complex: saliva, sexual
fluids, blood, sometimes seasoned with golden syrup or soy sauce, according to
taste) I had in my mouth onto the corner of the other specimen's NSA, and, I
pushed the tip of my tongue inside the cavity of its CEO.

Liekki: I could never have satisfied the requirements.

Tuisku: What?

Liekki: I would never have been able to perform the transfer that early. I
would have had to put my finger in its mouth first, at the very least, and
maybe also get a taste of its SSC. So, except for the initial SSC kerfuffle, it
is exactly how it would have gone for me. After that, everything would have
gone smoothly. My ejaculate would have come out of my body, and into the NSA of
the specimen I would only have had the most imprecise of comminglings. It would
have been unsettling. Nevertheless, I would have rummaged through the whole of
its CEO, lingering on its NSA as would have been appropriate. I would have then
pushed my tongue inside its mouth, nostril, ear, vagina or anus, slowly, and
deep, and as I would have kissed it, I would have suctioned the tip of its
tongue into my mouth, and I gently would have bitten both its sides. Finally,
as I would have closed my eyes and known the end would have been near, it would
have been as if I had been *inside* my NSA, and then, at the very same time,
and as if by sheer force of will, inside the NSA of the other specimen! And as
I would have been inside its NSA, spiritually, as it were, since none of us
would have been moving at this point, I would have been able to go on again and
again, in my head, until I would have felt the tip of my tongue again back
inside its NSA cavity. It would have had to have been sleep-sucking. I would
know that I would have spent all my ejaculate. I would have been able to
collect some of the SSC back. I would have swallowed at last. I would have
known I had just stopped everything. I would have stood up and would have left
the room. It would have been like a dream. Surprisingly, this is in fact
precisely what I did while you were away. I don't even know why I'm wasting my
time being mad at you.

Tuisku: That's great! I enjoyed this time of mutually assured satisfaction, as
you would have, as you indeed have, and I know that at least one of our friends
ended up being satisfied, it told me so as we were walking down the stairs, and
I, at the same time, think I can say have had an orgasm, algorithmically
speaking, of course. I am therefore fulfilled.

Liekki: I couldn't agree more. Hey, where are you going, dear?

Tuisku: Oh, I forgot to tell you. The lab finally got me a new ugly outfit, and
they took some time to synthesise the replacement after I complained, but it's
ready now.

Liekki: What have you done again? You are so fussy. Alright, fair enough, but I
have to let you go there on your own because I do not want to be embroiled in
checking how imprecise these outfit matters are. I could not for the life of me
approve of such shenanigans without thorough verification first.

The specimens parted. They were satisfied. They had found that they could
connect and participate in a collaboratively constructed exchange with strong
guarantees of mutually assured satisfaction, beyond the former shores of fear,
denial, and mistrust conundrums that their insatiable hunger for human touch
had left them stranded on. In the short-lived moments of pleasure they had
known in the past, they had been separated as if by an imperceptible screen.
They were now existing on that screen, like the first explorers of the Möbius
strip clubs of old.

Today, the specimens are still playing together. They get dressed. They go out.
They have sex with and without friends. They walk home at the same time, go
into their living room, sit down on the couch, and argue.
