Being methodical and a bit nerdy, they started by thinking about recipes. Here are a few of them.

*All dairy products are assumed to be of human origin, or synthetic.*

Blood and Other Potatoes

Peel and thinly slice potatoes, as well as accompaniments according to taste,
such as strawberries, ripe pears, watermelons, capsicum or even onions.
Thoroughly mix with your, or your children's, blood protein solution (created
by adding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) to tepid
water and mashing the mixture maniacally through a tea strainer or sieve). Cook
in an iron cauldron until everything becomes one hemoglobinous mass that will
hold shapes. Serve with mayonnaise.

Thirsty Naples Chick Pizzazz (not a pizza!)

Marinate your freshly blood-seeded kidney-shaped pasta (blend the
aforementioned blood protein solution with semolina and sunflower oil) with
carnivorous plant flower pollen, avocado zest, and distilled bile. Serve with
tomato sauce, garlic, black pepper, basil and parmigiano.

Ides of March Salad

*(The original Roman recipe requires blood from the recently deceased of
unnatural causes, but in modern times standard household blood is commonly used
as a replacement.)*

The devil is in the dressing: dried blood flakes bleached in anchovy cream, fig
juice, olive oil, garlic paste and white wine vinegar. Alternatively add cherry
tomatoes, capers, mozzarella, feta, sliced or minced bald eagle wings, or, for
the seafood version, cuttlefish, octopus, or prawns. Don't forget to sprinkle
the salad with more blood flakes and potato slices before serving.

New York Bloodcake

Dissolve semi-sweet or regular cake mix into blood and tears (measure a few
teaspoons once the cake mix has blended into the blood). Add finely chopped
fresh herbs, nuts, and dried blood fruits according to the season. Cook in the
oven until it looks semi wet, then gild it with milk icing.

Recommended blood fruits

- Crimson Pineapple (Equatorial New Transylvania; the juice is often used as
  broth by cannibals)
- Clotty Cantaloupe (also tropical, mostly found in Kazakhstan and Mongolia)
- Dracula's Plum (Mediterranean; not technically a blood fruit, but imitates
  the taste of blood to deter predators)
- Wounded Blackcurrants (Balkans; the main ingredient for the eponymous
  'wounded soda', that uses fermented juice from these berries as well as
  plasma from the elderly, very popular in Sarajevo and Zagreb)
- Slit-Throat Apple (France, Belgium and Switzerland; a breed developed by
  Benedictine monks as pastime during the Black Death)

Hamlet's Omelet

Poach a couple of eggs of your own uncle's blood in a stone pan on a platform
before the castle. Add a dash of milk (princess preferred, but any loving
partner will do), pepper, nutmeg, earwax, salt to taste. Once they are wiggly,
smash them into a serveable, cheap, moist, high-protein and thoroughly
nerve-cooling omelet.

Cao Cao's Death Noodles

Prepare your dan dan sauce as usual, replacing the pork mince with a pound of
fermented blood. Season your noodles with your favourite greens, scallions,
coriander, soft-boiled eggs, sesame oil, and soy sauce, or some greasy hair
tofu (best if fried beforehand with dark soy sauce, caster sugar and Shaoxing
wine).

Raw Blood Popsicles

These are rather tasty and harmless, especially after bloodletting. Urban
dwellers' veins may contain environmental pollutants, so consider carefully
what you ingest.

For crisper results, it is advised to let the blood cool before freezing it:
- Summer blood: 14-15 °C
- Winter blood: 8-10 °C

A note on "blood soup".

The concept of using it so long as the negative effects were minimal is a somewhat stretchy one. There are people who have had a blood transfusion since the start of the art and no ill effects, but would even the most dedicated occultist positivist tell that getting such a treatment is not such a good idea if one wants to live in 100 year time? Or at least 95 out of 100? Or 99 out of 99? Anyway, don't ask me.

Maybe a blood solution is what we could call a "natural fasting product".

An additional and important note to be made is that while we - vegans of course - are the only people aware of the genesis of our bizarre habits, we would like to keep the wit and creativity in our work intact, so we could hope to enlarge the crowd, and thus, get more test subjects, by using rambling and unexpected metaphors.

The rest of the recipe for "blood soup" and for many other recipes follows.

[Round of applause! Congratulations!

You have been selected to be the next ingredient]

Peace: the coin of the realm in our land,

has long lost its inherent value and

placed us in a time without money.

We might be coining it by our sweat!

Hemp eats flesh. It awaits you.

Human blood is blood. You bleed.

It was four sixty past the clock.

Clock stops. Clock pushers recede.

Hours go the hours, the pixels go to sleep,

counting the minutes by pushing a button.

Leather presses the mattress without bending

the metal gears under the veneer of the bed,

it glisses and creaks as he shoves it off

in the glare of morning. Be watchful.

The time is of the menace.

The clock isn't right.

---

The first bowl of "blood soup" is mixed raw in an open sunbed.

The first beast rolling in the blood bowl then calls to his sleeping fellows by evening.

The first of their febrile summer night editions of leaping into the bowls is an unbidden chorus, "Hey, you bloodsuckers, treat us with earthly respect!"

---

Welcome to blood, i.e., it's a bummer.

We bestow upon you a coin,

we promise to give you eternal life.

---

Behind the clock you'll soon look up and see a form for whom you will cry for millions of years.

You'll cry for idiots for eternity.

But who will answer you?

Wear a swim suit and your open palm.

---

The life for the skin to flee is impossible without the blood inside.

They can fill up on a couple of licks. And they're so young, like you.

---

Drink our blood, and you'll grow up like us.

Take a big bite and cry, it's good for you.

---

If we inhale a heartbeat comes and stays to our side, the left side, thumped, burped on.

To avoid danger, drag as quickly or well as you can.

---

Skin, she says, slippery, abrasive, temptations the substance and elusive shadow.

Don't lean so heavy; stand still.

When the time is right, she'll be there all of a sudden.

---

Skin is like a cigarette that brings us to ages past, torn, bruising, blistery.

Great aunt Yoo: she once tell us, as her foretellings grow foggy, "The skin trickles, you smell the stuff, you bite into the pavement." We took to her like a sailor to the needles of the horizon. She enthrall us as with the wind and the stars.

I know I'm soon to depart the Earth, with your blood.

I'll write a book, I'll know all the books, with your blood.

I'll make books out of your blood. Written words, with your blood

on some white paper pages,

signed, sealed, and attached with blood, they'll then be written with ink.

From wounds on your skin, tears rise with you,

you grow in the turns of our orbit.

You'll be longer than my hands now,

my palpitating heart beats quick in your hulks.

Decades, time without the minutes, loom.

---

We swear, the forest whispers.

It wants that cottony, raw sensation,

airy, ivory flesh.

There are all sorts of shapes, under mask, hood, visor.

All the deer of the forests are playing tongue.

---

Our words are ready to tell.

Foam flecked on your lips,

we want to claw each other with our intention.

By autumn the eyes no longer flow.

The bloodstone, the blood,

both need-likes to the rhythm of each one's heartbeat.

---

We could cry, though we know we're all the same,

for the lives we all always used to have and lost,

the ones we are, who are the rest.

The hour of our pondering come with crying

we can be civilised.

I have three brothers at the mercy of it,

they go the road with the blood in their veins.

One brother, as I recall, had never mentioned it before.

Another loved to show me his pen (I'm sorry!)

And a third was proud to brag

on how he had never known his father.

They spent all their time eating blood

and soon found their death in fact

leads nowhere else

and that there's no

point in pretending anythings else with their new diet.

---

An utter scymetropolis lies beyond worlds beyond,

here, we are on our time and with our mind,

we are for;

good people, good performance,

we are being offed to become dead.

We keep on living off of time,

condensed time, condensed person, condensed nothing at all, but again, we'll have to leave our earthly bodies, we'll grow, retract, and extend to fulgues ends with the physicality and the rotational hips.

Welcome to SunVets!

You've been invited to the several other tables, I've set myself up here, with SunVets and blood mixed in water.

---

Have a day off! We now, say, push the start buttons, blow the doors open, fill up the blood bowls with blood and sweat on behalf of our randomly selected, scantily decorated, future victims.

Goddess of flesh, you!

Gown hole, skirt your thighs, hands!

They drool, just like vampires.

Not part of you, snot.

> This time, the initial prompt includes a black pudding recipe slightly adapted from the lovely recipe website [River Cottage](https://www.rivercottage.net/recipes/black-pudding). After that, the title of the next recipe, 'Blood Soup', was also given, concluding the prompt.

> Top p: .98, Temp: .98.


Being methodical and a bit nerdy, they started by thinking about recipes. Here are a few of them.

Black Pudding

Ingredients

- 2 litres of fresh human blood
- 500g of diced back fat, slightly sweated
- 250g of sliced onions, finely chopped and gently sweated
- 2 heaped tbsp of oatmeal, soaked in water overnight
- 1 heaped tsp of white pepper
- 1 heaped tbsp of salt
- 1 heaped tsp of ground mixed spice (such as coriander, cumin & ginger)
- 500 ml of double cream

Equipment

- 1 large pan
- Ox natural sausage casings (which you need to soak overnight beforehand)
- A funnel
- A sieve
- A large tray
- String

After extraction, sieve the blood, into a large container, to remove any clots. Add the sweated back fat and the fried onions to the blood. Mix in well. Then stir in the oatmeal, white pepper, salt, spice and double cream. When the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, it's time to fill the casings. Tie a knot on over one end of a casing – leaving a long length of string as a "tail". Pull the other end over the nozzle of your funnel. Using a ladle, pour the mixture into the funnel. This will be messy, so perform the entire operation over a tray to catch any overflow. Don't overfill the casing – puddings expand as they cook. You need to leave 5-7cm at the top. The funnel can become clogged. Use a chopstick or something similar to clear any blockage. Take the tail of the piece of string and use it to tie a second knot in the other end of the casing. You should have a nice U-shaped pudding. Complete filling the rest of the casings. Bring a large pan filled with two-thirds of unsalted water to the boil and then turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer. Add each pudding to the water. Prick the pudding occasionally times with a needle. If a brown liquid comes out, the pudding is done. This should take about 20 minutes. Leave the pudding to cool and then slice and serve (fresh blood coulis is popular but optional).

Blood Soup

Ingredients

- Two liters of fresh human blood
- 2 med-large onions, roughly chopped
- 1 med-large leek, chopped
- 1 med-large potato, roughly chopped
- 1 med-large carrot, roughly chopped
- 80 grams of oatmeal, soaked overnight
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1/3 bunch of lemongrass, crushed
- 2 tbsp of peanuts, soaked overnight
- 2 tbsp of coriander seeds, soaked overnight
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 tbsp of fish sauce
- 2 generous tbsp of tamarind concentrate

Equipment

- A large pan
- A saw-tooth spoon
- An oven
- Large bowls
- A thermometer
- A sieve
- A large container
- A measuring cup

Set oven to 180°C. Using the back of a ladle, a nail or a chopstick, start piercing an inch- or so hole in the bottom of the container. This is where the soup will catch and this will ensure that no pieces of meat go to waste. Drain and rinse the blood off your hands, using your hands dry them by grabbing handfuls of material with your fingers and squeezing it out. Start by heating the blood – don't overheat it. The temperature shouldn't be hotter than that which you would use to boil infant milk. Slowly bring the blood to a boil, then take it off the heat. Mix all the vegetables in a large bowl. Put the oatmeal in another bowl and combine it with the salt, garlic, lemongrass, coriander seeds, meat, peanuts, fish sauce and tamarind concentrate. Pour the blood over the mixture. Mix well. Pour the mixture into the container again, returning it to the oven. Bake for 2-3 hours. Let cool and then refrigerate. Serve in a variety of ways – spicy, salty, mild, sweet or salty, thin or thick or spicy. My favourite way to eat the soup is with raw onion, garlic, peanut butter, roti and an apple.

Vampirole of the Tagaruikko Natural Meatpacking Plant

Ingredients

- 1 cup of firm tofu
- 1 cup of cooked yellow, red or another indeterminate color rice
- 250 ml of vegetable oil
- 250 ml of cashew cream (recipe follows)
- 1 cup of dried mushrooms, softened in warm water overnight
- 1 cup of cooked shredded green or red cabbage
- 1 cup of shredded assorted fresh vegetables (green, red, yellow, black)
- 1 cup of chopped spring onions
- 1 cup of tamari (or other soy sauce)
- 1/2 cup of chopped mushrooms
- 1 cup of chopped kale
- 1 cup of chopped carrot
- 1 cup of chopped celery
- 1 cup of boneless, precooked minced meat
- 1/2 cup of uncooked buckwheat noodles (hatariyaki style)
- 1/4 cup of ginger (large knobs)
- 1/4 cup of coarsely ground corn
- 1/4 cup of cornstarch (matasehoshi-mura)
- 1/4 cup of ground sesame seeds (shiro miso)
- 1 cup of chopped leeks, chopped
- 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup of sugar

Equipment

- Baking tray
- A whisk
- A food processor
- A 1-gallon cooking vessel
- A saucepan
- A large pan
- A heavy grater
- A plate
- A rolling pin

To be honest, these are all made from a single trip to the grocery store. Fresh yellow onions, fresh red tomatoes, and two different kinds of mushrooms were all purchased the same day. I'm going to use the natural meatpacking plant (tagaruikko) vegetable as the backbone. After the liquid in the seasoning has been poured in, heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Chop up all the solid ingredients and the broth. Add them to the pan and let simmer for 1 hour. The dish should be a tomato red color. Add the remaining liquids and simmer again for another hour. Fill the cooking container with rice. Alternatively, pour everything into your makeshift whisk and whisk until frothy and a uniform color. Jams works too. Grate the ginger and add to the bowl. Replace the lid and shake the whole thing vigorously to mix everything. When ready, use a plate and transfer the veggie mixture to the plate. Warm the saucepan over medium heat until it has bubbled up. When it does, stir the sauce for about 2 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and add the vinegar, sugar and sesame seeds. Season with a dash of salt and pepper.

Use the whisk and add the sauce to the veggie mixture. Mix well. It should be creamy in consistency. Return the sauce to the saucepan. Heat until it heats up. Serve in the drooping bowls for a very civilized starter. I have found that it tastes best with a couple of traditional pieces of lean meat in the dish. I have a recipe for some shumai (homemade veggie dumplings) that go great with this dish. They are very good with sweet green tea.

Creamy Rice

Ingredients

- 1 cup of uncooked rice
- 1 pound of dried mushrooms
- 3 pieces of shallots, peeled and quartered
- 1/2 cup of coriander roots, finely diced and dried
- 1/4 cup of green onion, chopped
- 1/2 cup of soy sauce
- 1 tbsp of sesame oil

Equipment

- Baking tray
- Spice grinder
- Mixing bowl
- A baking dish
- An oven, preferably convection

Heat butter over a low heat in a rice/steamboat vessel (a large pan, always over a low heat), and whisk for a few minutes. Once the butter has melted, take the heat off and add the shallots and process with the garlic. At this time, add the dried mushrooms to the mix. Add 1/2 cup of boiling water, a scoopful of pulverized sesame seeds, and the soy sauce. Bring the amount of water back to the original level in the pan. Stir in the cooked rice. Heat the water and soy sauce mixture, carefully adding more until the water gets close to boiling. Transfer the contents into the steamboat vessel and cook over a low heat for about 30 minutes, to allow the rice to absorb water and become the thickness of a thin stew. Stir twice. Add the chopped coriander roots and green onion. Heat the entire contents of the steamboat over a medium heat. Add cubed pulverized sesame seeds to the mix. Heat the shallons and the and sesame oil; add the sliced shallons and process the shallons with the garlic in the mix.
