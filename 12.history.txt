The Romans feed on the blood of their enemies, the Ancient Greeks drink the
blood of their slaves, the ancient Egyptians would eat the blood of their slain
enemies, and our ancestors fed on the recently dead. We only rarely hear about
it, and we assume that it happened only in the wild. But if our family history
is any indication, this inhumane feast was visited upon almost every human
population and culture on earth. Copley says that a constant point of
divergence throughout human history was "media as a weapon," the way that
humans progressively tried out different dietary practices for many years
before eventually adapting to them.

For instance, for several centuries, the Europeans did not eat pig. Why not?
Carnivorous animals are not particularly tasty. Finally, in the 17th century,
they got around to it. "They convinced themselves that it was the source of the
disease syphilis. They called it the 'pig and booze cook,'" Copley said. "And
they stuck on to it all the way to the hands of Michael Vick. This was the
opposite of the way we live now: we don't eat anything that doesn't taste
good." The pig-on-vegetable phenomenon really seems to have been the day-to-day
mainstay of most non-western cultures for a while. However, due to modern
medicine and sophisticated food preservation and preparation, we are now
completely immune to the health problems caused by this practice. The only
thing which is slightly undermined, at least from a medical point of view, is
that these animals are still killed in this way.

Our ancestors also ate a lot of meat and game. The sanguinivorous appetite now
seems to be confined to fowls and fish. Even our ancestors felt the need to get
their protein from the animals they collected. Indeed, traditional
hunter-gatherers still can't live without the animals which they were able to
kill and bring home with them, including half of all National Geographic
pictures published between the early 1960s and the early 1990s. These weren't
killed by their human fathers or mothers, just by themselves.

Animal men might have been bigger and stronger, but they didn't look so very
meaty. As for the mixing of human and sanguinivorous animals, early humans also
mixed easily. The extinct Neanderthals interacted with humans regularly. Over
the long run, it didn't seem to matter: human deaths have always outweighed any
possible benefit.

It has been suggested that one of the major advantages of sanguinivorous life
might have been that the sanguinivores encouraged monogamy among their mates. Even
if it wasn't the main reason, it must have been a major benefit. It's not known
exactly when this sexual link began, but it must have been an important step in
bestowing some high genetic inheritance to the children of such liaisons. When
humans found ways to kill their own children, or have conspire against their
parents, a man

of Religion, p. 74.

As to its being not merely a one-off incident, and a one-time phenomenon, but
is recorded in both the Old Testament and the New, says Dr. Poole, 'it is
rather remarkable that it is not more widely known. The butchery of the
Israelites is mentioned as far back as the days of Joshua, but it occurs again
the first time in the book of Genesis, and then in other parts of the Old
Testament. Cain was first killed by his brother Abel (Genesis 4:16–25), and the
first man to be cut in pieces was Esau (Genesis 25:1–5). In the second century
A.D. there is a Roman writer who records a sanguine in the case of a given
person at a given moment: when a Roman was tempted by the delicacies of Egypt,
he killed his wife, washed her blood from his hands, and then wrapped his body
in a coffin, laid it on a table covered with golden pomander, and ate the dead
corpse (Livy, Historia Augusta). There are also some instances of ancient Roman
soldiers eating human flesh (Aulus Gellius, Britanniae, 6.4.6; cf. Cicero, De
Finibus, 26.57). The scene in the Odyssey is of a sanguinistic assault by
Migol on his victim (Oyssey 4.252–3), and in the Indian epic of The
Mahabharata, the hero turns to sanguinism when poisoned by the poison of the
Brahmins (Atharvanam, 2.2.38–43).

The first recorded instance of a contemporary sanguinistic cult in Western
Europe may be the incident recorded in Greece about the year 404 B.C.E. when
Simon Magus, a young and ambitious priest from Alexandria, was being sought by
the assassins of the king, and begged to be allowed to test his skills against
his friends, who were already famous for their sanguinistic exploits. He
arranged a banquet on which the king's sons and daughters had been invited as
"most honored guests" (the Sicilians call them "leisires", "princes of the
feast"). They were offered a plate of flesh and celebrated with wine and a
great feast.

Simon presented himself to the king, who recognized him immediately and
recognized that he was not a mere servant but his brother in turn, who had been
a governor in the coast of Cyprus. He offered him his daughter in marriage and
sent for all the leading members of the royal household, hoping that he might
test them in his own blood. But the ceremony was a failure: when Simon the
king, who was very passionate, wanted to eat the rich sacrificer. He was
overpowered by the reaction of the crowd and the inquis enchate nobility, who
had

Sanguinism has a long, long history. It was believed to have occurred even in
the ancient world, and was the method of extermination performed by the ancient
Greeks and Romans. In more recent times, sanguinism was banned for the most
part in Europe, and almost vanished in America, but it has experienced a
resurgence in the last two centuries, particularly in the Western world, where
there are many sanguinism-minded groups like the National Alliance for the
Separation of Cultures (NASC) and Bloodstained Men, each of which has thousands
of members within its ranks.

Sanguinism has also been embraced as a form of religious expression in
America. Each of these groups are complete subcultures within their own
countries, each with their own beliefs, philosophies, and even rituals.
However, they all share a common goal: to fixate on a specific page of human
history, any page. They have set up a radio station, broadcast in English,
which would dispense with the usual commercial breaks and halfway through the
broadcast, would play a sermon by a man named John Derham. The sermon was
titled, "Was Jesus a Sanguine?" which is a great title on so many levels. And
it did not take long for the faithful to latch on to a particularly good part
of the sermon:

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the Pope is trying to drive a stake
through the heart of Christendom. It's not happening on the part of John the
Baptist. It's happening during the fifth century, during the Roman Empire, in
the city of Achaia (a Greek colony on the coast of Asia Minor). They destroyed
the greatest empire that the world ever knew – the Roman Empire – because they
wanted celibacy. Supposedly, they had a message that was a 'Love is stronger
than hate' – an 'Aha!' moment. And they came to a place called Achaia, where
they decided that we should all get together and have sex with each other. And
the message they had was: we can have sex with people who have been dead for a
hundred years, okay?

According to Christian belief, the bodily fluids of Christ were sacred, and the
actual blood of Christ was forbidden. This meant that the bread and wine from
the Passover, the body and blood of Christ, were considered to be unclean and
were actually a danger to anyone who consumed them. At least, that was the
venerable belief held by the Church. All sorts of superstitions and mythologies
grew up around the blood of Christ. A small portion of it was eaten. And at
least some of the passion of Christ was, well, everyone had a theory.

Now, this ancient Christian take on the story seems like a perfectly acceptable
one for pagan Europeans to swallow. Because this belief in blood as sacred is
something that would have likely been prevalent in ancient Greece, Rome, and
all the other parts of the Roman Empire, the ancient Roman populace would've
been very interested in such a story. A tale so popular that even its
sorcerer-priest-Pope claims were completely false? What a crazy, crazy world we
lived in. We're told even today that "Jupiter is the god of sex," and that this
is actually what all people have in common. In fact, there's a myth about how
all gods get it on and then just sit back and watch it all unfold. That way,
it's for all the good of everyone.

These pagan Europeans were certainly not ignorant of all this. They understood
the ideas of sacrifice and magic. From this, they would have understood that
blood was particularly forbidden. And they were also aware that blood was good.
They had no particular reason to think that sanguinism and sex were bad
things. In fact, the idea of a story where all the blood from a guy named Jesus
was eaten by a bunch of people and Jesus is magically magically healed by
eating the blood first and then shows up on all of their faces kind of sounded
pretty sweet.

Another way "The Blood Bank" relates to the etymology of Celtic is the fact
that it is named after a strip of iron shepherd's string used originally to
keep shepherd dogs from drinking too much from their own dog food. This iron
segment can be seen in the old copper coffin at burial sites wherein the doggo
clan is typically interred in Europe, and T. often wrestles the
high-quality teeth of his non-vegan prey out of the dogma-laden dead member's
skull with the occasional kill. This iron string has been the sole form of
feeding the Fauns, and the Fauns have taken to tearing it out and chewing it up
– then spitting it out.

Admittedly, this was not the first time that people had ever heard of
sanguinism. While there have been many guesses as to what the term
"Sanguinismo" might refer to, little evidence has been found to support this
theory. But when people heard the term "Sanguine Jesus," it went beyond the
shit-talking phase into complete freaking insanity.

Of course, it was probably also a few centuries before the first highly
publicized trauma of an openly sanguinistic Jesus ever hit the news. Which, in
turn, caused a massive increase in Morale.
