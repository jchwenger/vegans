**Peace**


The coin of the realm in our land

Has long lost its inherent value and

Transacted us onto a time without money.

We have been minting ourselves with our sweat!


We are the hemp that eats corrupt flesh.

We are the It that awaits you.


Human blood is coin blood.

You bleed, we get rich.

You die, we have peace.

---

**The Clock**


It is five past four on the Hertzberg Clock.

The Clock has stopped.


The red pushers have long withdrawn into their lairs.

Hours have come and gone, the pixels are asleep.

For how long have minutes been counted at the push of a button?


The leather tourniquet rests on the mattress 

Its thirst unbending

The metal gears creak under the veneer of the bed

Need slinks slithers shoves off

In the glare of the morning.


Be watchful.

The Clock isn't right.

Time is in on the menace.

---

Welcome to our blood summer.

Sorry not sorry, for you it's a bummer.

But, fear not.

We bestow back upon you riches in your own coin.

We merely promise to give you your own eternal life.

---

Walking past the Hertzberg Clock you'll soon look up and see in the dust clouds
the form for whom you will have cried for millions of years. An old face made
of billions of faces, smiling in all serenity at its own perennial cruelty. It
is for idiots that you will have cried for eternity. It is for scum you will
have called for. But who will answer you? As you walk past the Hertzberg Clock,
you will be surprised by gunfire from windows, and you will run for cover.

---

The life for the skin is impossible without the blood inside.
 
They can fill up on a couple of licks.

They who flee us now, they're so young, like me, like you.

---

Drink blood, and you'll grow up.

---

Drink blood, and you'll be like us.

---

Take your first gulp and cry, it's good for you.

---

If we inhale you for lunch

Our heartbeat comes alive and stays 

Aflutter in our side, the left side, thumping,

We feel its throb as we burp.

---

To avoid danger,

Or too much pleasure,

Slurp as quickly 

As as you can.

---

Skin, she says, slippery, abrasive.

Surface of temptations.

The substantive yet elusive

Shadow of my wish.


Don't lean so heavy on me.

Stand still.

The needle is ready.


When the time is right,

It'll be there,

Inside,

All of a sudden.

---

Skin is like a cigarette that brings us to ages past, torn, bruising, blistery.

Great aunt Yoo: she once tell us, as her foretellings grow foggy, "The skin
trickles, you smell the stuff, you bite into the pavement." We took to her like
a sailor to the needles of the horizon. She enthrall us as with the wind and
the stars.

I know I'm soon to depart the Earth

With your blood

In my belly


I'll write a book

I'll write all the books

With your blood

In my belly


I will make my books out of you

Puke-write my words

On white paper pages

With your blood

From my belly


Signed, sealed, our true bond

Your blood, my bile

My ink

---

From wounds on your skin, tears rise with you,

you grow in the turns of our orbit.

You'll be longer than my hands now,

my palpitating heart beats quick in your hulks.

Decades, time without the minutes, loom.

---

We swear, the forest whispers.

It wants that cottony, raw sensation,

airy, ivory flesh.

There are all sorts of shapes, under mask, hood, visor.

All the deers of the forests are speaking in tongues.

---

Our words are ready to tell.

Foam flecked on your lips,

we want to claw each other with our intention.

By autumn the eyes no longer flow.

The bloodstone, the blood,

both need-likes to the rhythm of each one's heartbeat.

---

We could cry, though we know we're all the same,

for the lives we all always used to have and lost,

the ones we are, who are the rest.

The hour of our pondering come with crying

we can be civilised.

I have three brothers at the mercy of it,

they go the road with the blood in their veins.

One brother, as I recall, had never mentioned it before.

Another loved to show me his pen (I'm sorry!)

And a third was proud to brag

on how he had never known his father.

They spent all their time eating blood

and soon found their death in fact

leads nowhere else

and that there's no

point in pretending anythings else with their new diet.

---

An utter symmetropolis lies beyond worlds beyond,

here, we are on our time and with our mind,

we are for;

good people, good performance,

we are being offed to become dead.

We keep on living off of time,

condensed time, condensed person, condensed nothing at all, but again, we'll
have to leave our earthly bodies, we'll grow, retract, and extend to fulgues
ends with the physicality and the rotational hips.

---

Summer and comfort. Light.

Ripe pomegranates studded with blood.

It exists and stands only once-in-a-while or so, and may subsequently dwindle
even with more as yet undiscovered ingredients in solutions to be used to
reverse the corrupting impulses of the latest generations, this time, get
shoved aggressively, readily, and we'll last a pretty long time.

---

Have a day off! We now, say, push the start buttons, blow the doors open, fill
up the blood bowls with blood and sweat on behalf of our randomly selected,
scantily decorated, future victims.

Goddess of flesh, you!

Gaunt hole, squirt on your thighs, your hands!

They drool, just like vampires.

Not part of you, snot.

No. Not the Rock 'N Metalites.

We know you from your self-center.

you will see that the

Squat, as the mother says he's gone,

what is smart is applied, but without

the cunning heart, which generates about

as much love for our cause as the basic fare.

> This time, the initial prompt includes a black pudding recipe slightly adapted from the lovely recipe website [River Cottage](https://www.rivercottage.net/recipes/black-pudding). After that, the title of the next recipe, 'Blood Soup', was also given, concluding the prompt.

> Top p: .98, Temp: .98.

Being methodical and a bit nerdy, they started by thinking about recipes. Here are a few of them.

**Black Pudding**

Ingredients

- 2 litres of fresh human blood
- 500g of diced sea coconut fat, slightly sweated
- 250g of sliced onions, finely chopped and gently sweated
- 2 heaped tbsp of oatmeal, soaked in water overnight
- 1 heaped tsp of white pepper
- 1 heaped tbsp of salt
- 1 heaped tsp of ground mixed spice (such as coriander, cumin & ginger)
- 500 ml of double cream (Teat Treasures or Maternal Love are both great
  brands, but the bounty of any sound woman's breast will do)

Equipment

- 1 large pan
- Natural sausage placenta casings (which you need to soak overnight beforehand)
- A funnel
- A sieve
- A large tray
- String

After extraction, sieve the blood, into a large container, to remove any clots
or any impurities. Add the sweated back fat and the fried onions to the blood.
Mix in well. Then stir in the oatmeal, white pepper, salt, spice and double
cream. When the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, it's time to fill the
casings. Tie a knot on over one end of a casing – leaving a long length of
string as a "tail". Pull the other end over the nozzle of your funnel. Using a
ladle, pour the mixture into the funnel. This will be messy, so perform the
entire operation over a tray to catch any overflow. Don't overfill the casing –
puddings expand as they cook. You need to leave 5-7cm at the top. The funnel
can become clogged. Use a chopstick or something similar to clear any blockage.
Take the tail of the piece of string and use it to tie a second knot in the
other end of the casing. You should have a nice U-shaped pudding. Complete
filling the rest of the casings. Bring a large pan filled with two-thirds of
unsalted water to the boil and then turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer.
Add each pudding to the water. Prick the pudding occasionally times with a
needle. If a brown liquid comes out, the pudding is done. This should take
about 20 minutes. Leave the pudding to cool and then slice and serve (fresh
blood coulis is popular but optional).

Creamy Rice

- 1 cup of uncooked rice
- 1 pound of dried mushrooms
- 3 pieces of shallots, peeled and quartered
