So why does this story have an uneasy sexual undertone? Why do some males admire the semen of women who have sucked blood?

Why do some females view feeding on the blood of other people as a genuine aphrodisiac? Let’s explore these questions.

Let us assume that the two ladies are two people for which a major aphrodisiac trigger, the adulation of men, is very present. They are starved of that basic feeling of sexual and social acceptance. We also assume that the hunger for semen is so strong and acute that, in this case, the blood is just an easily accessible source of fertilizing liquids, rather than a rejection of women in general. The less intense appetite for male semen, on the other hand, is probably the hunger for the love and support of fellow men. In this situation, the two women would both find blood more appealing than semen because blood is for both of them the source of human life.

As for sexual maturity and readiness, the two women are of legal age and, more importantly, have the requisite degree of self-esteem. Finally, they want to experience something new and unfamiliar. The desire for the feeling of ejaculating semen while being orally stimulated by a man is probably of little importance for them.

The women make sure that their saliva is clean, they use water to rinse their mouths, and they use a tongue depressor to clean the roof of their mouth. Then they insert one finger of each hand in their mouth, place the index fingers of their other hand on their clitoris, and slowly begin to massage their clitoris with their index fingers. The two women stay perfectly still during this process, with their head held upright and their eyes closed. Then, when their index fingers are lubricated, they begin to push the tips of their index fingers slowly inside their mouth and on the inside wall of their lips, as if to simulate swallowing. They move their fingers in tiny circles, and they begin to move them in small and steady clockwise and counterclockwise motions until the tips of their fingers reach the back of their mouths. They repeat this exercise until they feel a mixture of saliva and their blood move down the back of their throats and the back of their throats feels sticky. When they think that they have reached their desired consistency, they slowly pull their fingers out of their mouths.

All that remains is for them to arrange their faces into positions of enjoyment. The women open their eyes, smile, and tilt their heads, until they feel their blood dripping down their chins. Then, they smile, lick their lips, and begin to rub their clitoris with their right index finger until they reach a moment of rapture. To be able to report this story, I had to ask the two women about the pleasure they felt in their tongue and in their clitoris. They explained to me that their clitoris was all their body parts for pleasure. They said that the only things that tickled them were their nipples and that they really liked having a sweet drink in the summer.

After that, one of the two women began to straddle the other and give her a firm but delicate oral caress, until she gently inserted the tip of her index finger into her anus and gently moved it to the end of the rectum. She went on until she reached the end of her finger. Then, when she felt a mix of blood and her ejaculate, she pulled her finger out and smiled. The other woman understood. She began to move her hands and to stimulate her clitoris. She was gently opening the petals of her vagina with her fingers. She continued to move her hands until she felt the clitoris of the other woman. Then, she inserted one finger into the other woman's vagina, took it out, and kissed the blood off of it. She then turned her back to the first woman and used her tongue to lick the blood off the tip of the woman's penis. When she had cleaned the length of the penis from top to bottom, she applied the tip of her finger to the end of the tip of her tongue and pushed it inside her mouth. She repeated this procedure again and again until she felt her ejaculate run out. She stroked her clitoris while swallowing. Then she repeated the whole procedure with her left hand, until her blood had run out and she felt satisfied.

The end

This story is a little confusing. It is said that “as we both began to move, we continued until our ejaculate came out,” and then she says “until I felt my ejaculate run out,” but I don’t know what these words mean. She also says “I rubbed my clitoris with the tips of my fingers,” and then “I used the tip of my finger to clean the end of my tongue,” and “I repeated this procedure again and again.” This reminds me of an Indian story where a man is about to be eaten by an alligator, and he says “the worst thing of all is that I’m starting to think about all those babies I’m going to have to feed.” All of these stories could be confusing, and I want to make things clearer, but I’ll have to leave this story exactly as it is.

The two women, sharing a moment of pleasure, achieved a short-lived moment of sexual satisfaction, one that was born out of a profound need, because the absence of human touch had made them so desperate. However, to use the term “touched” as they did, the women did not experience mutual, mutual satisfaction. The sensual, physical pleasure was taken, but there was no exchange. They said that they found pleasure in exchanging pleasure with each other, and each had sex, but they did not have sex with each other. To those women, sex was about love. It was a meeting of emotions, values, ideas, and souls. It was, as a man said in the story of “Briefless Man,” a union of souls. To achieve mutual satisfaction, women and men both have to look deeply inside themselves to realize that human touch is a thing that can never be separated from the life of the other person.

When the two women finished, they kissed each other, they embraced each other, and they both, for the first time, felt that they were actually, really “satisfied.” Then, they continued with their lives.

There are many nuances and layers in the responses, thoughts, and ideas that you get from these stories. Some men view blood as the touch of another human being, and others see it as an inseparable part of their own blood. I find all of this very interesting. I hope that you do too.

Another day, two women ate together. They went to their girlfriends' place. They got dressed and came home at the same time. Their four friends were waiting for them. The women walked into their living room, sat down on the couch, and said:

The first woman: What happened, girls? Did anything special happen?

The second woman: Nothing, dear. We just had a really nice time together.

The first woman: Don’t lie, you two were out till after one in the morning! What happened?

The second woman: Nothing happened. We just had a great time.

The first woman: Great, very great. What did you two do all night long?

The second woman: We got some food, we ate, we drank, we talked, and we laughed. That was the only thing we did.

The first woman: I don’t believe you, you two were out until after one. Where did you go?

The second woman: To the hairdresser.

The first woman: Ooh, no, that’s a lie!

The second woman: Not that bad.

The first woman: That’s a horrible lie, too!

The second woman: Do you think that I’m lying to you?

The first woman: I know that you lied!

The second woman: If I told you the truth, it would break the bonds of friendship between you and me.

The first woman: We used to be best friends, but, in the end, I found out that I couldn’t trust you.

The second woman: I didn’t want to tell you the truth, but I did.

The first woman: What? You didn’t tell me the truth?

The second woman: Yes, I did.

The first woman: Oh, really? You didn’t have a chance to think about it beforehand? You didn’t stop to think about what would happen when you told me the truth?

The second woman: No. I didn’t do that, but I could not avoid doing so.

The first woman: What could you avoid doing?

The second woman: Even though we are best friends, I can never trust you again.

The first woman: I know that you have lied to me.

The second woman: Okay, okay!

The first woman: I could not trust you again.

The second woman: No. I could not think of the consequences of telling you the truth.

The first woman: You’ve cheated on me.

The second woman: Not at all.

The first woman: “Not at all.” That’s just what all men say, dear!

The second woman: I only have to look in a mirror to see that my breasts are bigger than you always admit. That’s why you don’t trust me.

The first woman: You have to look in a mirror to realize that your breasts are bigger than mine, but I can’t tell you why, because the reason behind that reasoning is much larger than my brain.

The second woman: That’s why I can’t tell you why I have so much bigger breasts than you. I also have to look in a mirror to know this, but it would be so stupid to tell you why I have the opposite relationship with your breasts.

The second woman: I know that you’re the only one to whom you talk with anything like precision, but the reason why that's the case is so much smaller than the reason why I can't share my most private thoughts with you.

The first woman: That’s it, too! That’s why I don’t trust you, dear. I am also the only woman with whom I talk with the same amount of precision as you, and I know why I keep things secret with you.

The second woman: I did not know that there were other women in the room with us, and, so, we could become even more devoted than we were before, because we both wanted to be there. That was your “reason.”

The second woman: No, it wasn’t like that. In the end, I, alone, left this room.

The first woman: You, alone, went into the room, and you have, alone, gone out of the room?

The second woman: Yes.

The first woman: What on earth did you feel when you turned the lights on?

The second woman: I felt like, as the stream of my blood was not mixing with the stream of my ejaculate, it was not intermingling. I drank my blood, I drank my ejaculate, and I enjoyed my pleasures.

The first woman: No.

The second woman: Yes, I did.

The first woman: You willed your blood to run out of your head.

The second woman: You were their best friend, and you were, now, completely satisfied.

The first woman: Why were you going to the hairdresser?

The second woman: You see, we two had to go out to get food, drinks, and a haircut. The third woman’s hairdresser said to us that we should look at our breasts together. When we examined them, the end of one of my breasts was dripping with blood. My blood was already running. I had to squeeze the end of my penis and to put it in my mouth. After I cleaned it, I was giving the saliva of my mouth to the end of the other woman’s penis, and, I pushed the tip of my tongue inside the mouth of my penis and inside her vagina. I licked her clitoris. I tried to clean the tip of my tongue with the end of the tip of my penis, I cleaned it, I sucked on it, and then, I went on until I felt the tip of my tongue inside my mouth, I licked the end of it and swallowed. My ejaculate was out of my body. I pushed my tongue inside her mouth, slowly, and deep, and I licked her, I took the tip of her tongue into my mouth, and I licked her lips. Finally, I closed my eyes and I was inside my penis, and inside the vagina of the other woman, and inside her vagina, I went on again and again, until I felt the tip of my tongue inside the mouth of her vagina, until I felt that I had spent all my ejaculate. I swallowed. I had just stopped.

The other woman: I could not satisfy her.

The first woman: What?

The second woman: I had to put my finger in her mouth, and I had to taste her blood.

The second woman: I enjoyed this time of mutual satisfaction, and I know that she is satisfied, but she is not satisfied, and I, at the same time, have an orgasm, and I am fulfilled.

The women were satisfied, but they were not satisfied with each other. The women found that they could connect and exchange mutual satisfaction, but there was a fear, a denial, a mistrust of human touch that left them hungry for human touch. In her moments of pleasure, they were separated by a screen. They were, on that screen, shared a short-lived moment of mutual, mutual satisfaction.

However, to use the term “touch” as they did, the women did not have sex with each other, but, they shared, and, at some level, mutually satisfied each other, for a short period of time, and for the first time, in their lives. Their sex was about “touch”, as it was not separated from their human blood. The women had sex, but they did not have sex. They did not have sex with each other, and they had an orgasm. However, they did not satisfy each other. Each one of them found satisfaction in their desire to touch, and they exchanged a moment of mutual, mutual satisfaction. However, to use the word “touch,” or to eat the same human feelings, values, and ideas, women have to understand deeply inside them. Mutual satisfaction, then, is possible, if one believes that they can be satisfied in that moment of pleasure. To exchange, and not to exchange, is, as one said in “Briefless Man,” impossible. It is a matter of spirit.

Sex between women is about friendship, intimacy, respect, and love.

Sex between women is the recognition that, as a man said in “Briefless Man”, you can only have human touch when your life is inseparably linked with the life of the other person.

Sex between men is the men’s sex. When we have it with women, women experience human touch as another part of our human blood. I don’t find this very interesting. I hope that you do too.

There are many ways to interpret and respond to these stories. Blood is human touch. Blood is an inseparable part of each human being’s blood. I find all of this very interesting. I hope that you do too.

Today, four women are playing together, they got dressed, and they walked home at the same time.

The first woman: Where are you going, dear?

The second woman: They got me an ugly outfit, and they took some time.

The first woman: You are out till the next morning! You really went out the night together?

The second woman: No.

The first woman: You! The two of you were out all night?

The second woman: No, we were out together till one in the morning.

The first woman: Oh, don’t deny it!

The second woman: I didn’t have a chance to think about what would happen when you told me the truth? You didn’t stop to think about what would happen when you told me the truth?

The first woman: I didn’t believe you when you said that you hadn’t told the truth.

The second woman: I used to be your best friend. Now I can’t trust you.

The first woman: That’s a horrible lie, too!

The second woman: No, it’s true.

The first woman: How could you betray me?

The second woman: Not that bad.

The first woman: I could not trust you again.

The second woman: I didn’t want to tell you the truth.

The first woman: Do you know what you did?

The second woman: I lied to you.

The first woman: Yes, I know that.

The second woman: We’ve used to be best friends, but, in the end, I have trusted you, and I know that you are the only woman with whom I can have to speak about secret things.

The first woman: Yes, you two could have stopped to think about the consequences when you told me that you had the opportunity to be and you told me the truth.

The second woman: Yes, I was going to tell you, too.

The first woman: You turned out the lights, didn’t stop to think about what would happen?

The second woman: No.

The first woman: You lied to me.

The second woman: How could I avoid doing that? I just had to tell you, and, now, you and I have an orgasm.

The second woman: No.

The first woman: You lied to me.

The second woman: Yes.

The first woman: I know that you were telling me the truth.

The second woman: What have you done?

The first woman: I have, however, to leave you alone because I wanted to know how, where I could not.

The second woman: I was so happy to be doing what the two of you were having.

The first woman: How do you like the two of us doing this together?

The second woman: That’s how I think that you should be doing it.

The first woman: But this is impossible.

The second woman: I’m very tired.

The first woman: He, you lied to me about anything. I wouldn’t believe you were.

The second woman: I didn

Their reactions, despite being equally enthusiastic, was nevertheless markedly different. E., for instance, couldn't stop wondering why the onset of their regimen was so evocative of thrilling and uneasy sexual undertones? T., on the other hand, struggled to reconcile himself with a growing, shameful and unavowed fetish for the semen of women who have sucked blood – the fate, so he would learn, of so many blood vegan males. Neither could have imagined the radical turn their sex life was about to take.

A few days into the carnivorous regimen of oral and anal blood-sucking (also referred to as vampirism or vampire, etymologically speaking), a completely unexpected thing happened: it seemed to the two vegans that they had just been licked clean by some sexual entity. Neither of them recognized that this figure who indulged in a full-sensory relationship with them, with its sexual and non-sexual components, was other than their partners. The identity of the new sexual companion was quite impossible to pinpoint. As it seemed to the latter, both the penetration during oral sex and the rimming during anal sex represented a one-in-a-million chance, but the fact of the matter is that it wasn't they who consciously consented to this role-play, but they who were seduced by it. A fortunate accident, they concluded. The first indicator that they were dealing with a new sexual environment beyond the limits of their imagination, an intimacy entirely outside the comfort zone they had ever explored before was this unexpected outcome.

Most disturbing, it seemed so ordinary to them. They had licked and sucked one another before in numerous scenes of boundless pleasure. The new scenario, however, seemed to come without a penis. Both of them were disappointed by the lack of that particular physical component but, even more, they felt self-conscious about the lack of male sexual organs or semen. The simplest way to neutralize their uncertainties was to consummate their relationship through top/bottom "rape-sucking" or "oral biting." The seed of this term originates in the course of time, the fusion of two of our closest relatives, which ignited, as a by-product, an oral relationship of sadistic and masochistic undertone.

They came to understand that this relationship, this confrontation with a figure they couldn't immediately recognize and this sexual engagement with a level of mutual desire they haven't encountered before, was another poignant sign, an indication of their well-being in relation to their social groups, another indication of their progress towards their own modalities of monogamous and non-monogamous couplings.

In the eyes of their friends and colleagues at work, though, the previous norms fell by the wayside, as did their couple routine, a fact which wouldn't have been more apparent had not their friends and colleagues greeted their informed decision by an unbelievable reaction. It was everything but a guilty expression. Both of them felt newly freed to take risks, to defy limits, to expand their capacity of enjoyment to new highs and new lows. Despite their fondness for monogamy, their urge to be together seemed to be replaced with a desperate need to escape from any confinement by not willing to compromise on their romantic preferences. The way they used their new discretion, confidence, and flexibility seemed to speak more than a mile. An enjoyable yet excruciating predicament this regimen of carnivorous blood-sucking was, at least for the long-time pair of vegans.

They experienced their relationships as never before, an increasing need to be alone and an equally intense desire to commune with their loved ones. Due to this dynamic sensuality, the nature of their relationship kept changing. Days spent together seemed to have been replaced by nights of passionate and intricate fantasies. It went on until their arms, shoulders, and necks were covered in poisonous pus-like or disgusting substances.

At some point, all the gloom dissipated: The dark cloud that covered their relationships lifted. They were off their best, but their appetite for blood remained as strong as ever and their eagerness to feast on the nourishment of those who had nourished them was only encouraged by their strict nadir of sexual energy.

When they realized that they wanted to feed on human flesh, they succumbed to their cannibalistic urges, hiding their fetishes under the pretext of their beloved vampirism. Let them have their trifling desires! This was a time of life when everybody needs a vacation.
