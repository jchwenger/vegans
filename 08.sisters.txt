### 8.

In a series of passionate lectures and a hundred confrontations with the
political, religious and ideological situation of their age, they persuaded
themselves that this was absolutely fine – that they were ready for it – and
even pawned their tongue rings in Fleet Street in an effort to give more fuel
to the fire of their conviction, to force themselves never to give up the
fight. These fascinating women took a huge risk, but it paid off, and they
almost immediately felt a surge of vitality from the blood. After many contact
experiments, they realised that given only a very short adaptation period – a
few days at most – they could maintain the same blood pressure, cholesterol,
BMI and cardiovascular tonus as someone who lived on animal blood! That was a
profound and deeply unexpected revelation. However, reckless copycats of their
method soon started to die and, unfortunately, as decentralised lifestyle
contagion events – also known as 'Standalone Complex Swans' in pandemic
parlance – were not a class of psychosocial diseases European countries had had
much experience with before the Black Death of 1346, they had to escape the ire
of the Church, bury their discoveries as well as themselves in a dim and gloomy
basement in Helsinki and resign themselves to a life in hiding, keeping busy
with scientific study and crochet. The sisters, sustained by their miraculous
practices, lived on for hundreds of years, digging underground galleries
connecting all the great cultural centres of Europe – the Gotthard Tunnel under
the Alps is said to be one of their best known works still in operation –,
until a former pupil and later informant of theirs, Charles Robert Darwin, FRS
FRGS FLS FZS, gave away the location of their London hideout – a derelict cave
in a mews of West Brompton that would later be rented by Samuel Beckett – to
his wife Emma before mysteriously dying during the Long Depression of
1873-1896. Emma, with the best of intentions, went there the next morning with
a basket of Dracula's plums, and opened the rusty door of their dungeon. The
two grand old ladies did not survive the fetidity of the Victorian air more
than a few minutes.
