A couple of vegans from Helsinki, Finland, T. and E. (fictitious names), while,
they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and were
very happy with their new diet when they turned, as it reflected their ethical
ideals as much as it fostered their gastronomical imagination, and it seemed to
them that this exciting bliss would go on forever. However, after a while, they
confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and more often
to nag them. After many feverish brainstorming sessions, crises of doubts, and
outbursts of hope, they came up with an idea: they would feed on each other's
blood.

The idea proved so wonderful that they soon became radicalized. Only days after
the beginning of their regimen, they had imagined, and subjected themselves to,
the most stringent discipline and training. After a year, they were
combat-ready. They booked their plane tickets, and flew to San Antonio, Texas,
landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As E. and T. felt the Southern
sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their lungs, they felt joy
contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well decided to kill
meat-eating humans.

A couple of hours later, two corpses with their heads brutally severed and
their claws peeled clean walked calmly to the edge of the camp, and hung there
until they vanished forever into the battlefield dust. Meanwhile, Petter
Himmelstein was now hunted. War was now spilling into his home, and it was
sheer survival, not getting caught, which would prove to be the difference.
Such efforts in the pursuit of wisdom reflected the qualitative contrast of
mindsets of people as distinct as I experienced them. The large number of
blood-eating people kept talking of their awakening; my group was very small.
On my own, I sensed much in common with the antigunz. We both experienced a
sense of adventure as our ideas started to enlighten us about a small show of
activity, but we became quite different once we got to know each other. We
differed, most important, in our dynamics. The antigunz were highly motivated
by a deep desire to discover the truth and help others. The antigunz, the vast
majority of them, were compulsive light-weights. Their discomfort in such
conditions was not because of a physical defect like malourishment or
malnutrition, but was the outcome of a personality; to adapt to the difficult,
to modify, to undergo a collective degeneration of thought. None of the
distinguished Swiss, American, German, British, Russian experts knew a single
antigunz, had not met a single antigunz, and were, therefore, in no position to
criticize my self-serving attempt to form an opinion, which, of course, the
knowledgeable experts would have likely remarked upon. These self-styled
experts provided all-encompassing perspectives of the world, which could not
excepted any nuance of experience. The values, beliefs, and perspectives of
their peers were the only authoritative sources of truth. The result was a
breach of peer-evaluative view of the world, a world their collective
experience had built up, a world in which the individual sat at the pinnacle of
the world hierarchy, the point where a new rule of "alternative" had been
superseded by a new law: "The truth is the dominant factor." What happened next
was obvious, and in the interests of the antigunz did not take long to come. Of
the forty-six thousand antigunz at the rear of our camp, only a handful,
perhaps two or three, remained. Every single one of them was immediately taken
by the Germans and concentrated at the military base at Matzketten. Since
winter was near, and the field blizzards came with increasing frequency, those
few survivors were pushed to the rear. The field where the bodies of the
antigunz were found and the place they were found were about a kilometer from
each other. "Welcome to summer warfare." I heard once in a private
conversation. The defeated antigunz could not always recognize the prosaic
series of war procedures as the apocalyptical guerrilla attack they had always
been led to believe. They would actually become units which, as they advanced
through the Western front, played quite a heavy role in the battle's day-to-day
activities. They would sleep in the trenches, usually in groups of five or ten
men, and would lay side by side on the train tracks for the transfer of their
bedding. These foot soldiers had come from all over Germany, often without
food, sometimes with money in hand from a rich person or private enterprise. In
the autumn of 1917, an appeal would bring them all together at the battlefield.
Usually, a person who did not have a sound mattress became so embarrassed that
he would immediately give up this embarrassing practice and make his peace with
his bed. Most of the antigunz who provided any material aid to their comrades
would die in the trenches. Every day they ran less and less of the trench and
the cover of the forest, while the others continued their onward march. After
some six or seven thousand men had been covered by the German/Sintifront smoke
screen, the Germans would "cleared the route" through the forest, but an
avalanche of small-arms fire and shell fragments would blossom at the
foothills, setting both man and machine into formless fragments. This would
drive the survivors to the most convenient camp, and tell them they had no
other choice than to use their rucksacks to keep on going, gunning their shells
along. Thanks to the terrain and the prevailing winds, the crawling insects,
they were always hungry and at the risk of exposure to newly-night. They jumped
from embankles, mauled by American fire, to move—the mobile-driven in the worst

A couple of vegans from Helsinki, Finland, Tuomas and Eevi (ictitious names),
while, they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and
were very happy with their new diet when they turned, as it reflected their
ethical ideals as much as it fostered their gastronomical imagination, and it
seemed to them that this exciting bliss would go on forever. However, after a
while, they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and
more often to nag them. After many feverish brainstorming sessions, crises of
doubts, and outbursts of hope, they came up with an idea: they would feed on
each other's blood.The idea proved so wonderful that they soon became
radicalized. Only days after the beginning of their regimen, they had imagined,
and subjected themselves to, the most stringent discipline and training. After
a year, they were combat-ready. They booked their plane tickets, and flew to
San Antonio, Texas, landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As Eevi
and Tuomas felt the Southern sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their
lungs, they felt joy contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well
decided to kill meat-ating humans. Ever convinced of the moral and spiritual
superiority of their philosophy, they tore into those who came to stop them.
The enemy quickly encountered resistance, and began to look for an elusive
exit. Eevi said of those who challenged him to a fight, "Even if it's just a
sip of a blood wine or a bite of a human heart, I am ready."As the brothers
charged in, they did so carrying a pair of hooks, spear, and a prod to poke
flesh and gore into those who opposed them. War was waging: one also began
pitting forces against each other, and you can be sure they had each other at
their backs, bringing them well beyond the point of so-called mortal combat.
Initially, the organization was ruthless. After little experience, they killed
their first victim. Juana Cruz was and elderly, the last of the Spanish agents
of the CIA, who had betrayed them, and was seized by the two killer brothers
and later found beaten, tortured and strangled.In the beginning, they were
mostly successful: they captured their first hostages, and could feel the
devil's breath upon their lips. They knew the fear they were inflicting on the
victim was strong, but were only filled with gratitude for the blood and terror
they had brought to him. You can be sure they would not stop until they had the
surcharge of victims they felt they were entitled to. Like it or not, the
world, the society, as well as nature itself had a reason to fear them. They
had only a fraction of the power they were accustomed to using, but they still
had the same motivation: their mission.The danger posed by the brothers to the
world was exposed to the world in the form of their trial by the world's
judicial system: in just five days, two human beings were brought to trial for
killing other human beings. The brothers were pronounced guilty and sentenced
to die by the hangman. Their families were outraged and demanded full
absolution for the crime of their mad brothers. A trial date was set and the
two brothers were transferred to a prison in Bryan, Texas. There they still
remained.Nevertheless, the brothers went with their hestitutas, their
conscience intact. They continued their mission by committing more crimes:
among other things, Eevi, with a sharpened wooden stake, gored as many people
as he could find in the history of the world, and did the same to several
prostitutes, their targets. The bloodlust had not gone entirely, but it was
still a powerful force at work within the brothers.Suddenly, though, fate would
intervene. As the brothers were being transported to the gallows, a far bigger,
meaner person, a woman, Juana Cruz, stepped outside the prison in Bryan and
confronted Eevi and Tuomas with the facts that would help them decide their
fate.Tyshawn Shute knew what was coming. He had been informed by Eevi and
Tuomas of their intended mission, had let the murderers know that they would be
taking them down in a blaze of glory, and, as he had been the one to make the
first kill of the pair, he was also their target. However, he was not just the
last of the cannibals: he was also a bit of a softy, given that the pair had
hoped to extract the maximum benefit from his death. At first, Tyshawn planned
to allow the two to eliminate him, but his intentions were drastically changed
when he saw how evenly matched he and Eevi were.Eevi cried out in triumph when
Tyshawn made a move to defile the spot where his coffin was supposed to be,
while Tuomas laughed and courteously made conversation to please him. He began
pleading with Tyshawn, and, as the trials continued, they went on the
offensive. Tyshawn shot at them, but each time they dodged the attack, Tyshawn
revealed he had concealed a more lethal weapon, a water pistol, and shot Tuomas
in the chest. Tyshawn, stunned, was seized with a feeling of panic, as the pair
laughed and faced each other. Moments later, they heard the clatter of boots of
footsteps approach of unknown persons. At first they thought they were
Tyshawn's, so quickly they set up their trap: Eevi and Tuomas positioned
themselves on a dark slope, while they were impaled and shot, aiming for the
side of the land. D. Eevi and Tuomas landed easily fell from the side of the
cave, while they ran over the cliff and found themselves on each other side,
but slowed their due to slow but Tyshawn took the main thrusts of a gunshot to

and Tuomas felt the Southern sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their
lungs, they felt joy contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well
decided to kill meat-ating humans.Although they had shot up their home town,
they had not killed a single human and had not even killed any animals (except
for the cats and dogs). After their first year, they managed to reach 300
revenge killings. An, unlikely story of the survival of an imperialist ideology
while facing the dark reality of the ecological meltdown is told in this
report.The fugitives fled there on the equivalent of the $50,000 bounty placed
on their heads. They were identified by the Nazis as terrorists, and their
exact location was revealed only through a chance telephone call from the local
police. It was a simplistic case of mistaken identity; they were not wearing
typical uniforms and were of a completely different nationality from the rest
of the Nazi-like militant force. After a few weeks, Eevi and Tuomas reached a
commun with a few members of the German-speakers in the region. In the commun,
the fugitives lived in tins of tar, their feet drenched with the thick manure
generated from a communal kitchen. Under the open sky, the fugitives grew tired
of their climate and the reality of their natural environment. The Leningrad
bandits were cut off from the rest of the world. They managed to create an open
and democratic environment that allowed them to adopt their principles without
delay. The first TOL members often say that if they had been able to survive
together, they would have succeeded; they would have started TOL, and the rest
of us would not have been able to ignore their exemplary role in this attempt
to establish a libertarian socialist society. A very important reason why a
communist-anarchist movement that is saying all the right things but is not
getting traction among the rank and file is vanishingly unlikely to have the
kind of success that the Leningrad students had. I say this because the
Leningraders are pioneers; there is a P.O. box at the address of one of their
contact people, and the number of young people who contact them from time to
time is considerable. The most serious attempt to establish a
communist-anarchist movement failed to take place in Russia because it is very
difficult to hide the nature of a movement that is explicitly atheistic, and it
is also very dangerous if a movement is disillusioned with a reactionary,
bourgeois leadership. Two years ago, and within six months of the Leningraders'
initiatory struggles, a group of religious zealots who wished to move toward an
almost holy-war against the communists started an anti-religious public
campaign, constantly threatening them with imminent arrests and worse. To
explain their position, the groups asserted that if the religious persons
continued their current religious life, they would be "turning towards hell."
As before, the communists responded to the threats with people's defense
organizations. But the tactic of going to the authorities to challenge the
slander has been rejected by the communists and marked the beginning of a
retreat into a defensive, battle-oriented attitude. Later on, the communists
were ready to accept the fact that their opponents were ready to attack them,
but still maintained that many of their opponents were bandits. As a result,
they believed that the brutal stab in the back can be justified. As for the
religious-hator groups, they quickly abandoned the idea of attacking the
communists, which they had believed to be a mortal danger. The ground on which
they stood was eroded and lost its meaning. At the same time, the class
struggle between the individual and the class became more and more evident.
Freedom of speech and a free press were recognized as basic rights, and in the
social sphere, individual rights were being extensively expanded. It was
natural that the religious-hator groups were unable to survive within the very
vision of human rights that they had once used as an argument against
communism. And yet it is important to stress that the most important part of
the problem is not only the question of individual rights, or of the building
of the social relations of production. The problem is not that the effective
exercise of freedom of opinion has become restricted in Russia. The problem is
actually that the development of the most basic features of freedom of speech
and of a free press - freedom of speech and of the press - is being severely
restricted. And many people cannot even speak their minds. Once they have
received a chance to speak, they become very popular. Some of them are
possessed of what is called "techiechesakivre-anii-ten" - "sacriding." Others
believe in "the great tradition." When a person speaks up about problems or
political issues, he is heard by his neighbors and friends. And he sometimes
talks up to his pets at home. If he says to his parents and his siblings. He
goes to his girlfriend. If he should call his pet. If he calls his friend. He

and subjected themselves to, the most stringent discipline and training. After
a year, they were combat-ready. They booked their plane tickets, and flew to
San Antonio, Texas, landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As Eevi
and Tuomas felt the Southern sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their
lungs, they felt joy contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well
decided to kill meat-ating humans. One day, when the peacefulness had faded,
they found themselves on a battlefield. They had to fight. Tuomas and Eevi slit
the throats of several unarmed soldiers. Theirs was a beautiful and bloody
deed. In the following phase of the battle, the couple killed many more. One
day, they killed many more. One day, they had killed enough American soldiers
to provoke an American invasion of the island of Bikini. If they had to live as
part of this noble conquest, they thought, then they would live on forever!

19 After this triumphant action, Eevi and Tuomas decided to go back to Finland,
but not without cover; they had a quick break from horrific murders and decided
to smuggle themselves out of the country as quickly as possible. They were one
of the earliest survivors of Bikini. (They had to get back to the North, they
knew, because their blood that used to have effect on the American troops who
came to bomb the island had been washed off by the nuclear waves.) They escaped
towards North America and soon found themselves in a small city, where they
found a Japanese family whose house they had to wreck to bring them food. When
they reached the family, they broke into the house and dumped all the supplies,
food, and meat they could find at the feet of the terrified Japanese family.
They made it home just in time for the devastating 100-kiloton nuclear
detonation which was the official start of World War II. Eevi and Tuomas, no
longer interested in nuclear war, decided to return to Japan. As autumn came,
they began farming and raising cows.

20 After six months, they were stronger than ever and, don't you know the name
of an airplane? it's the one that burns up in the sky with the memory of
humanity? Eevi and Tuomas could now speak Finnish and they had their own
country. They received lucrative employment, which they greeted with open
hostility from the politburo. Their first challenge was to decide their new
international government and give them a new name. After a long struggle and a
lot of annoying "it's wrong!" objections by the politburo, Eevi and Tuomas
decided on "The Revolutionary Party of Finland" (Alahalli Jaamatkin Panki).

21 In the years that followed, the Government of Finland refused to accept or
help Eevi and Tuomas, by refusing to send military equipment, negotiations, air
missions, and financial assistance. In 1995, a tiny group of Finnish citizens
traveled to America in an attempt to help them. They were not able to do more
than convince people that Alahalli Jaamatkin Panki is a good name. They
provided them with a few black-shirted operatives whom they regarded as
psychopatics. They gave them hints about the island of Bikini and its
situation, but they were not able to help them as they wanted. By the time this
tiny group of Finnish citizens had left the Island of Bikini, everyone on
Bikini had died.

22 Suicides and post-traumatic-stress disorder began to take their toll on the
couple. On at least two occasions, Tuomas, in despair, lashed out at Eevi with
his knife, causing more wounds than any other weapon. He then confessed to his
wife that he believes he can now see the future, and that is why he is willing
to take his life, which "is good" he thinks. Eevi suddenly agreed to kill
himself, fearing that he might die before his spouse would be satisfied that
the suicide is complete. He drove to a point along the road which had been
marked on the map. As he reached it, he turned around and jumped, aiming for
the neighboring mountains. Tuomas, who witnessed his suicide along with the
rest of the bystanders, knew that he had intended to drive his car off a cliff.

23 The Finnish citizens were eventually able to get the United States
Government to send some small military equipment, including an unmanned
underwater vehicle, to assist in the rescue operations. Their attempts were
successful, and the couple were rescued from Bikini. However, the ordeal had a
deep, lasting impact. Eevi and Tuomas felt that they had been robbed of their
fatherhood, and identity. Eevi still feels that his thoughts are more sinister,
due to his extreme fears, his religious phase, and deep-seated guilt, as well
being terrified, about the inner turmoil he always holds in his wife that he
cannot escape, his mind. Eev's to rid the one's.

San Antonio, Texas, landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As Eevi
and Tuomas felt the Southern sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their
lungs, they felt joy contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well
decided to kill meat-ating humans.As a first step, they purchased several cow's
heads and skulls, and then proceeded to put them on human bodies. As if they
meant to prove a point to themselves, they volunteered for murdering the first
couple of youngsters. Suddenly, members of the local NCOs and noncommissioned
officers were rushing to the scene. When the cops rushed to the scene, they
shouted "Kill! Kill them!" and began taking out their weapons. At the same
time, Tuomas realized that he was no longer being treated as a good soldier,
but as a suspect, and he began to panic. After a long struggle, he escaped by
rolling up a recent acquaintance's trousers as a human shield. His beloved
friend was the only one whom he did not kill.Even though he was guilty and
killed his own friend, he still wanted to believe that he was brave and took
part in an exciting noble mission to save the world of man. Consequently, he
did not feel sorry or feel in remorse; he felt that he was the right one and
the only one who should be executed. He also felt that he had no place at the
battlefield. Eevi knew that he had to do what was necessary to rescue his
beloved. However, he also realized that he would not be able to live with
himself if he failed to do it.Still, he made a vow that he would continue the
mission and complete it no matter what.The first step for Tuomas was to talk to
Eevi with the same angst that he felt. The first thing that they did was to
take the heads off the corpses of the two children, and put it onto Eevi and
him. As they were undressing the bodies of the victims, all fell into a fervent
exclamation of "Ah! The human beings can be eaten!" The families were
mesmerized by the spectacle. Finally, the bodies were lined up on the ground.
Eevi and Tuomas proceeded to eat one after the other, claiming they were
impressed by how delicious the human flesh tasted.Then, Tuomas walked into the
house of the little boy, and when he was complimented by the body of the
five-year-old, he said, "Let's eat more children and then see how much human
flesh we can consume." Eevi attacked Tuomas. Tuomas tried to defend himself.
Before long, Eevi was stabbing Tuomas with a sharp knife. His life's blood
spilled all over the floor, on the blood of those who were murdered. Nobody was
on hand to help Tuomas. Eevi grabbed Tuomas by the neck and cut off his head,
his eyes and his ears. Tuomas started to scream: "Help me!" Eevi stopped the
bleeding and then threw Tuomas down on the bed. He then decapitated him, and
ate his lungs and his heart. As he chewed his famous body parts, he proclaimed,
"I have finished the first world war now I'm going to do the second one."The
emotions and hunger of the families were intense. They saw that the children
were so beautiful, so innocent, and so loved that they were willing to live
their lives for them. Their delight was sharpened by the sight of a cherubic
child who, before the eyes of all, said "Oh death is mine. I will take the lips
of the captives as my bride. Oh death is mine". A year went by and nothing
happened. The children did not come back to life. When their parents looked for
them, they did not answer. All of the parents felt like they had died. Eevi and
Tuomas eventually filled their stomachs with the bodies of the children, and in
this way they were able to feed on humans for some time. Then they took the
heads and the necks of the corpses and threw them in the fire.Tuomas stood with
his head in his hands as he allowed the fire to consume his tiny remains.
Naturally, nobody noticed how his face and face turned yellow. Later, after
some weeks, a fallen tree shook a fire and killed the body of Eevi. Tuomas was
in this state. He and Eevi hoped that at least he would not get his body burned
to ashes by the fire. So Tuomas sighed. But the tree did not dozing tree had
another trick; a will of its own and afterward, found that the remains of Eevi
were still there.By this point, Eevi had lost all his teeth and his mouth.
While Tuomas looked on the road to be carried out his head, it. He did not mind
his eyes and the eyes. He waved them. Eevi was not mind the remaining for him.

San Antonio, Texas, landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As Eevi
and Tuomas felt the Southern sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their
lungs, they felt joy contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well
decided to kill meat-ating humans. They took a dozen pairs of rented leather
gloves, each with a special odor repelling cloth wrapped around the back, and
open their mouths.One by one, they soaked those gloves in blood while Eevi and
Tuomas executed, with lethal dexterity, the consumed victims one by one.Eevi
and Tuomas took part in a gruesome killing spree in which they gorged
themselves with human flesh that was soaked in blood. The blood that had been
allowed to pool in the blisters and ears of the victims intoxicantly stimulated
their emetic glands, thus eliminating all symptoms of hepatitis. This act was
highlighted by a blood stained paper with a red word in the center,
"KILLED."Eevi's cold-blooded murder spree ended when he turned his pistol on
his "heroes" and shot Tuomas once in the chest. He then calmly walked out the
back exit and with a gun in each hand, went to the nearest marked police post
to report, "I've shot those guys!" He still remained very remorseful about what
he had done and was still very sorry for getting involved in such a gruesome
and violent death sport. Thus, he made a verbal suicide attempt, but
fortunately caught sight of a lone cop and tried to surrender peacefully to
him. He was deprived of this chance, as the cop covered his head with his
body-armored vest, and shot Eevi twice more.Eevi died of a single bullet wound
to the chest, which was a mortal wound. (On the evidence, Eevi's age was
probably approximately 35, and his death probably occurred sometime in between
1990-1993.) Tuomas however, was much more fortunate. He survived the shooting
wounds, but was gradually gaining strange insights about the world. He could
clearly see that all had lost their sense of separateness. Without any real
tangible harm, humans are now all one and living in the same closed
environment. After finally ascertaining the cause of death, he has achieved a
very significant insight. He believes that human life is meaningless and that
it is the inherent destiny of all humans to finally disappear from the
planet.This sad sight is seen in the photographs entitled "Kinatarjuapaagi",
which are being published in book stores today. Tuomas's final words in the
photographs above are "I once knew the truth! I was not only the killer, but
also a victim at the same time! Humanity itself is a worthless argument!"Tuomas
and Eevi also gained enough insight to re-examine their own stance on the
"Animal Holocaust" and beyond. Their ideas changed. They stopped killing
humans. They came to a realization that they themselves were guilty of the acts
that they had committed. In this way, they had genuinely changed.The bottom
line is that there are no apologies, no "we forgot to stop" or "we feel bad
about what we did" type of moral statements. In fact, it is the meaning and
intention of the actions that matters. Either the meaning is there and
significant, or it isn't. I have seen this in action many times on both sides
of the possible intersection of ideology and the person. It is the intention
that matters. The sincerity of the activities that may be subtle as well as the
kamikaze violence they went through. Both sides might be well meaning, but the
sincerity is the important thing.The re-kindling of passionate friendships is
one of the true golden-hued gems of open-mindedness. It is the prelude to the
ultimate satori, the transcendent, ultimate wisdom or enlightenment that is the
core of any Buddhist philosophy. It is the best proof of the fact that one has
truly embraced the Dhamma, even in the face of severe privations. It is the law
that one must reap what one has sown, all the way up to the supreme goal of
enlightenment. It is the highest proof that one has truly achieved the "end of
suffering". Thus, in the case of Eevi and Tuomas, it is a supreme law of
affairs that they both have done meaningful, lasting and selfless activity in
the human society as non-killers.It is also a great challenge that they have
endured for over these years. They have experienced certain opposition and some
judgment from friends and relatives. But what they have done is certainly
worthy.For example, there was an article in a white paper a few months ago in
the newspaper of a very conservative town in southwest US, since it was that
said that they did not agree to any form of the decision.In a very conservative

A couple of vegans from Helsinki, Finland, Tuomas and Eevi (ictitious names),
while, they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and
were very happy with their new diet when they turned, as it reflected their
ethical ideals as much as it fostered their gastronomical imagination, and it
seemed to them that this exciting bliss would go on forever. However, after a
while, they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and
more often to nag them. After many feverish brainstorming sessions, crises of
doubts, and outbursts of hope, they came up with an idea: they would feed on
each other's blood.The idea proved so wonderful that they soon became
radicalized. Only days after the beginning of their regimen, they had imagined,
and subjected themselves to, the most stringent discipline and training. After
a year, they were combat-ready. They booked their plane tickets, and flew to
San Antonio, Texas, landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As Eevi
and Tuomas felt the Southern sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their
lungs, they felt joy contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well
decided to kill meat-ating humans. As Tuomas remarked, they had no problem at
all shooting each other. Their senses were heightened by the adrenaline of
their whips, their eyes were bright and focused as they took aim with their
deadly weapons, and they were imbued with an almost supernatural will to live.
Furthermore, they were vampires!The night before their baptism, they initially
insisted on drinking blood from each other, and on eagerly consuming each
other's blood, but later, after more questions, they realized that only bone
would do, and so they decided to devote themselves to killing each other's
bones.The first few days went by rather smoothly. Eevi was good and plenty.
Tuomas was fresh and possessed of an abundance of vitality. In small cuts,
tuomas was able to find his prey and carve into it in a not-too-long time,
while Eevi was able to slaughter a goat in a few seconds.The lethal frolic,
however, came to an end quickly after from all the wounds that were oozing
rapidly, as not only did their skin soon turn green, but their bowels were
completely full of the blood, while their bowels would rapidly empty, and it
would be very difficult to urinate. In these circumstances, the quick
dissection of their parts was totally effective.As with all wars, the two
virgins were prepared with their weapons and camping equipment, but with
different intentions.Tuomas was ready for his people to retaliate for the
accusations and for the disadvantages that the new regime had caused them. He
was ready to deliver a blow, to strike against his brothers, to tear off their
heads, and to cut the veil of secrecy that hid them. Eevi, on the other hand,
was more active, a warning shot raised to all the earth, and a bullet fired to
send the downcast and pitiable human-like creatures to their fate.The first
shot missed its target but struck Tuomas to the chest, where it exploded,
bursting his skin and killing him instantly. His heads struck the ground, with
blood flying everywhere, Eevi was less lucky, the bullet had struck him on the
heart and brought a swift death, which lasted even longer than Tuomas'. In this
way, Tuomas and Eevi were executed together and displayed together, their heads
pointing to each other on the wall of the woods.This is how the first vampires
were born. As prophesied, the worldwide slaughter of humans, the deaths of
animals, the destruction of infrastructure, the suffering of suffering, the
personal suffering of every living person from the suffocating inebriation of
blood, the terror and wonder of hearing about the suffering of a
more-than-a-few others, the endless killing of grassland, of trees, of grass,
of wildlife and so forth, soon followed.This is how, the first generation of
vampires, were born. The generations that followed were the next generation of
vampires.As humans entered the 21st century, those who had been living in the
past were still around. Many of them were still very close to each other,
trying to tell each other the story of their vampires. Many of them were living
as vampires, just a little bit different from the traditional vampires. As
hunters, they hunt poachers, other criminals. They were often called
"Butchers".But there were others who were less prone to violent behavior, more
peaceful, more seeking to do good deeds, but some others were violent, and
others were the more peaceful and diplomatic. Others still were born out of a
gray zone between the two extremes. Some were born as human-made vampires, born
in the 19th century who had not been born as a vampire, and some others were
born out of human-made vampires who had once been born as vampires.Some of
these human-made vampires were children or teenagers, born who had only
recently been converted. After they had experienced the strongest orgasms and
the most intense lust, they went through the stage of "transition", the
transition through childhood and adolescence where they, as vampires, held the
same attraction for humans as before they had or maybe even stronger than
before. But they didn't realize that this longing was not solely for their
mothers, but was also for humans. They couldn't understand this urge to be
liked, and the only thing that kept them from calling to kill them was their
innate shyness. Their romanticism was only weak and didn't excite them to lust,
and lust, and jealousy. They didn't feel sexual desire to be loved and didn't
feel a need to be wanted or be loved. As they lived life. But as they grew up
through their teens and matured, they were well aware of their sexual feelings,
they looked for others, their own selves, as they started to be proving they
were already sexual, as adults, aware of, few were sexually and none were
thought they were already having sexually on, consenting; and having sexually.
The lowest As they all understanding and such feeling, they enjoyed that
despite the sexual;

and Tuomas felt the Southern sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their
lungs, they felt joy contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well
decided to kill meat-ating humans. They then, while making a mockery of the
Pentagon's prohibitions concerning the military feeding of prisoners, proceeded
to the prison, and at the expiration of hours passed a man on the office floor.
Eevi's legs were ready. His two friends then carefully sheathed their weapons
and laid out the weapons around the man, the two of them sat on either side of
the man, the man's legs were still spread open, and one of them lifted his foot
onto the man's face, the other pressed the trigger with a fixed look on his
face. But what made Eevi laugh was the sound of the shot through the flesh.
Unbelievable burst from the bullets and the face was still open. There was
blood flowing from the hole which had grown in the face. Inside the man's neck
was a hole, the bullet had penetrated through the end of it, and one of the
bullets pierced the main artery. Eevi and Tuomas all then pretended to be
shocked by the act which was carried out by these men, when they were actually
laughing with excitement.After the shooting, the man was dead, and Eevi and
Tuomas pretended to be the most shocked by the incident, when they were
actually laughing with excitement. After letting out their pent-up laughter,
they reported their experience to their commander, who gave them quite a lot of
satisfaction because they had successfully practised their sadistic acts and
turned them into reality.Nariaki Aoki, an official of the peace talks between
the Japanese government and the Soviet Union, attended the scene, where he was
receiving information about the news from an eye-witness of the event. He was
nervous because the two members of the trio on the contrary accepted the
dramatic news, and they realised that it was a trap.Aoki was not a vegetarian,
and he took them seriously because he did not believe them. However, he got no
satisfaction out of their act, because in his mind, there was no way that a
ravenous cannibal with any kind of deviousness would not have long ago
presented the fact of their agreement with the government to his own superiors.
Consequently, he was ever cautious about not happening to bump into them in his
work in the office.At the same time, the President of the Soviet Union,
Khrushchev, was also there, and although he had been invited to the reunions of
the human race, the two men had not yet made any statement and Aoki was hoping
that he would turn up. Hoping that the two men would discuss the matter with
him, he, in turn, proposed to bring up their pact with Japan with the North
Korean authorities.Khrushchev had stepped out of his room, invited the two men
and the third point of contact of the peace-alks, which was the Soviet
diplomat, Yuri Nilus. They went together to the press conference, during which
Nilus introduced them to Edvard Zagradsky, a journalist of the Moscow-based
newspaper "" The only US envoy present that day was the State Department's
assistant secretary, who was in the process of covering the whole affair.Aoki
thought that the appearance of a traitor was an urgent matter. Though they did
not say anything, he knew it was impossible to talk with them and he looked
around to see if anyone might be eavesdropping on their talk. However, Nilus,
Zagradsky and the reporter were alone together. He kept out of their contact,
and made his inquiries discreetly. Finally, he reported the news to Farber, the
director of the US State Department's special secretariat. The press-conference
was reopened and the Americans and the Soviets continued. After a while, the
identity of the two men was finally revealed.Eevi and Tuomas were terribly
gaunt, and they desperately needed to slaughter, and preferably for food, other
human beings. Thus, they came as they did, with one sitting on each side of the
dead man and the other is are the decapitated head. Both these objects were
made for the purpose of experimentation with the human blood as food. The
length of the face-surgery was two but four fingers, and the width of the
stomach was three fingers. They then lied down on the floor and started to dig
up the skin of the man's skin while the other one said:In the near future, or
before the beginning of the next six thousand years, I'll return to
investigate, and I'll ascertain what more and more shall be made upon the
technique or a seat of the new sensation. I'll reveal to an amusement, and the
chasm regarding the merry other. Eventually I'll beseen be there I'll find I'll
