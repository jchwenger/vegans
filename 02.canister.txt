Not only, they explained in a post, would this help them discover where their
most intimate problems lay, it would also allow them to satisfy the blood guilt
they had both started feeling at the age of three or four, after having
binge-watched documentaries on the involvement of Finland with Nazism and on
the siege of Leningrad. It was a conclusion that came as a surprise to Tuisku,
after a longer and rather painful session – it had been Liekki's turn to play the
role of the psychoanalyst that week – and one that, unfortunately, Tuisku is still
not ready to share with the world, as he announced on social media last week.

For a while all they did was thinking about methods and looking up recipes.
Soon they knew more about black pudding than even the hungriest of Scots, but
despite their best efforts they couldn't shake off their disgust. A fresh
infusion of blood, squirted far into the mouth cavity, on the other hand, was
enthusiastically embraced by the intrigued Finns – although, being two
snowflakes at heart, they spat most of it out at first. Far from discouraging
them, their initial reluctance spurred their brutality and creativity alike.
Indeed, they quickly realized that the precepts of tolerance and softness they
had been educated with were of little use, or at least proved much less
efficient than brute force, when it came to keeping each other's appetite
quenched. In order to make sure that none of their weekly meal went to waste,
one would keep the other down, kneeling on the other's arms while operating the
canister (that was the name they gave the device, half a funnel and half a
vacuum-cleaner, that they engineered together for their dietary purpose) with
their two hands. The main challenge was getting the blood back from the floor
into the rebellious mouth and preventing the famished brat from skipping one
more intake in the spur of the moment, usually by shrieking uncontrollably and
rolling around on the floor until exhaustion.

After a couple of weeks of living and eating together, they were able to relate
to each other – but, with the exception of Liekki, their bland conversation
turned into a lot of verbal punishment and practice in that aspect. Putting up
with each other's sickening regurgitation fragrances was too much for Liekki,
and she was soon experiencing many bouts of constipation. Tuisku was even more
agitated, practicing hard his swallowing, and spending all his time between
meals to coax or threaten his friends into returning to veganism.

The arrangement surely seemed unstable, but, thankfully, they endured it, and
the end result was surprising for all involved: their work productivity
improved, as did their relationships with their neighbours. Pirate recordings
of the sounds of their cleaning their kitchen were leaked on the Internet. They
never prayed again.
