### 6.

Being methodical and a bit nerdy, they started by thinking about recipes. Here
are a few of them.

**Black Pudding**

Ingredients

- 2 litres of fresh human blood
- 500g of diced sea coconut fat, slightly sweated
- 250g of sliced onions, finely chopped and gently sweated
- 2 heaped tbsp of oatmeal, soaked in water overnight
- 1 heaped tsp of white pepper
- 1 heaped tbsp of salt
- 1 heaped tsp of ground mixed spice (such as coriander, cumin & ginger)
- 500 ml of double cream (Teat Treasures or Maternal Love are both great
  brands, but the bounty of any sound woman's breast will do)

Equipment

- A large pan
- Natural sausage placenta casings (which you need to soak overnight beforehand)
- A funnel
- A sieve
- A large tray
- Some string

After extraction, sieve the blood into a large container to remove any clots
or impurities. Add the sweated coconut fat and the fried onions to the blood.
Mix in well. Then stir in the oatmeal, white pepper, salt, spice and double
cream. When the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, it's time to fill the
casings. Tie a knot on over one end of a casing – leaving a long length of
string as a "tail". Pull the other end over the nozzle of your funnel. Using a
ladle, pour the mixture into the funnel. This will be messy, so perform the
entire operation over a tray to catch any overflow. Don't overfill the casing –
puddings expand as they cook. You need to leave 5-7cm at the top. The funnel
can become clogged. Use a chopstick or something similar to clear any blockage.
Take the tail of the piece of string and use it to tie a second knot in the
other end of the casing. You should have a nice U-shaped pudding. Complete
filling the rest of the casings. Bring a large pan filled with two-thirds of
unsalted water to the boil and then turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer.
Add each pudding to the water. Prick the pudding occasionally with a needle. If
a brown liquid comes out, the pudding is done. This should take about 20
minutes. Leave the pudding to cool and then slice and serve (fresh blood coulis
is popular but optional).

**Blood Soup**

Ingredients

- Two litres of fresh human blood
- 2 medium large onions, roughly chopped
- 1 medium large leek, chopped
- 1 medium large potato, roughly chopped
- 1 medium large carrot, roughly chopped
- 80 grams of oatmeal, soaked overnight
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1/3 of a bunch of lemongrass, crushed
- 2 tbsp of peanuts, soaked overnight
- 2 tbsp of coriander seeds, soaked overnight
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 tbsp of dulse and miso paste
- 2 generous tbsp of tamarind concentrate

Equipment

- A large pan
- A saw-tooth spoon
- An oven
- Large bowls
- A thermometer
- A sieve
- A large container
- A measuring cup

Set the oven to 180°C. Using the back of a ladle, a nail, a chopstick, or, even
better, a saw-tooth spoon, if you are lucky enough to have one, start piercing
a hole of an inch or so in the bottom of the container. This is where the soup
will catch and this will ensure that no clump of blood goes to waste. Drain and
rinse the blood off your hands, and, without licking your fingers, dry the
juiciness a little by grabbing blobs of material with your fingers and
squeezing some of their life out. Start by heating the blood – but don't
overheat it. The temperature should not be hotter than that which you would use
to boil infant milk.

Slowly bring the blood to a boil, then take it off the heat. Mix all the
vegetables in a large bowl. Put the oatmeal in another bowl and combine it with
the salt, garlic, lemongrass, coriander seeds, peanuts, dulse and miso paste as
well as the tamarind concentrate. Pour the blood over the mixture. Mix well.
Pour the mixture into the vegetable bowl, stir generously, then pour everything
into the large container again, returning it to the oven. Bake for 2-3 hours.
Let cool and then refrigerate. Serve in a variety of ways – spicy, mild,
savoury, sweet, sweet and sour, thin or thick. My favourite way to eat the soup
is with raw onion, garlic, peanut butter, roti and Robespierre apples.

**_A note on Blood Soup_**

*The recent attacks against the concept of using yourself as nourishment, even
in sensible, middle-of-the-road cases where the 'negative' effects remain
minimal, are based on somewhat stretchy arguments. There are people who have
had a blood transfusion since the start of the art with no ill effects.
Besides, would even the most dedicated occultist positivist be able to defend
that getting such a treatment is not such a good idea if, following it
carefully, one can be guaranteed still to live in 100 years' time? Or even if
that is one's innermost desire? Maybe those critics should remember that a
blood solution to health problems like the one we propound is what can be
called a 'natural fasting product', a time-honoured ascetic practice and a
pathway to spiritual and scientific enlightenment.*

*An additional and important note to be made is that while we – vegans of
course – are the only people truly aware of the genesis of our 'bizarre'
habits, we would like to keep the wit and creativity in our work intact, mostly
by using rabid rambling and unexpected metaphors. Thus we hope to enlarge our
crowd and get more test subjects, and we sure make no secret of it.*

**Kotteri Hakata Vampirole with Tagaruikko Natural Meatpacking Plant
Vegetables**

*freely adapted from the book by Matayoshi & Shimura*

Ingredients

- 1 cup of clotless, precooked minced blood
- 1 pound of firm tofu
- 1 cup of cooked yellow or red rice or buckwheat noodles (other indeterminate colours are
  tolerated)
- 250 ml of vegetable oil
- 250 ml of cashew cream
- 1 cup of chopped leeks, fleeced
- 1 cup of dried mushrooms, softened in warm water overnight, chopped
- 1 cup of shredded fresh greens or cooked cabbage (green, red, yellow or
- 1 cup of chopped kale
- 1 cup of chopped carrot
- 1 cup of chopped celery
  black)
- 1 cup of chopped spring onions
- 1/4 cup of corn
- 1/4 cup of sesame seeds
- 1/4 cup of ginger (large knobs)
- 1/4 cup of cornstarch
- 1/8 cup of salt
- 1/4 cup of sugar
- 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar
- 1 cup of tamari (or other soy sauce)
- 1/2 cup of shiro miso (white miso)

Equipment

- A baking tray
- A whisk
- A heavy grater
- A thin spatula
- A food processor
- A 1-gallon two-phase separation vessel
- A saucepan
- A large pan
- A plate
- A rolling pin

To be honest, these are all made from a single trip to the grocery store. Fresh
yellow onions, fresh red tomatoes, and two different kinds of mushrooms were
all purchased the same day. I'm going to use the Tagaruikko Natural Meatpacking
Plant vegetables as the backbone (I do not know when it shut down in the first
place, but it has been derelict for many years, I'm sure you also went there
for illegal raves as a teenager, and now their produce market is definitely the
best out there. The 200-ft by 250-ft metal building was originally used to
store the slaughtered and packaged meat before their final sale to customers,
and it's now abandoned and filthy: the walls are so dirty that you would expect
the inside to be as sour as a cow's ass. The floor, however, is perfect, that's
a big mystery.). I don't know why the shop assistant instructed me to fry them,
but I noticed his glazed eye, accentuated by the greenish hue of both
internal and external mucous membranes, distinctly sending "good for
cooking" signals, so I stopped doubting and bought everything.

First, let's get the broth sorted. The process is straightforward (but still
important, don't lose focus!):
- Grind the corn moderately with a heavy grater.
- Mash the sesame seeds with a thin spatula.
- In the food processor, blend the corn, sesame seeds and ginger together to
  the desired consistency.
- Mix this with the cornstarch in order to obtain a pouring consistency. Add
  salt and sugar after this, and allow to stay.

I use a nuclear grinder, but that's not important, use any device will do, even
your teeth if that's what you've got. Having a clear mind and an even hand will
enable you to melt this into a smooth mixture, which you then pour over all the
ingredients.

Proceed by placing the ingredients (worth no more than ¥3,000 ($23) in total,
I'm not kidding!) into the baking tray.

After the life liquid – seasoning, really, jam works too, just don't tell
vampires – has been poured in, leave it to rest for two hours. Chop up all the
now gored-up solid ingredients – leeks, mushrooms, greens or cabbage, kale,
carrot, celery – and add to the broth. If you find yourself without leeks, for
instance, don't despair. Worry not: you can "borrow" the innermost layer of the
onion and the tendermost piece of garlic you have as a makeshift substitute,
keeping the other layered onion halves on the side.

Now, heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the magma to the pan
and let simmer for one hour. The dish should be a tomato-red colour. Add the
remaining liquids and simmer again for another hour. Fill the cooking container
with your noodles. Alternatively, pour everything into your separation vessel
and whisk until frothy and a uniform colour.

Until the ingredients are completely softened, put aside the vegetable disaster
you have just created.

Now your attention should be turned to the tofu.

If you have purchased a moderate-sized weight of tofu, peeling will not be
necessary. So go ahead: never mind retards that are late for work.

I find this rather useful: instead of removing the film from the intact skin,
thin it out with a pastry brush. At this point, I like to break the tofu into
two slabs and provide the tofu with one half of its original head of garlic.

I'm impressed by the flippancy in which this massive block of soft, whitish
goodness is pulled from its packaging and laid facedown into the saucepan. I
did not have any special gloves or a ladle to cut through the wrapping, so I
resorted to a firm grip of my food-slicing hand and voilà! I cut the skin off
but was horrified at the resulting tenderness on the "pressure points" of my
fingertips. The last time I felt this was when experimenting with a classic
dish you may have heard of, "Cao Cao's Death Noodles". What was to be done, you
might ask? I simply applied a chemical agent to the area, hit it a couple of
times with a rolling pin to numb it, and kept tearing the wrapping parchment
paper without a shred of a feeling.

The tofu is placed facedown, and a 5-minute immersion period is initiated. The
temperature of the water determines the final product. If the water is
lukewarm, the water is lukewarm, no big deal. And if the water is hot, the
tofu's flesh will boil away. No judgment either way, believe me. Remember, this
is remedial cooking for the lazy. The worst thing you need to do is go through
the trouble of assembling the ingredients. This can be made nearly at any time,
which is why it's been adopted as a standard dish on long-haul space freight
ships. 

You must thoroughly rinse the tofu so that no traces of the original water
remain. I prefer to begin the moulding process with the water still in a
boiling state and "squeeze" out all pain by continuously rinsing the affected
parts. If I see too much water pouring out, I will wipe the excess off with the
back of my ungloved hand. Trust me, you never want to be the person whose name
is called during those times when the subway is running out of buskers playing
music.

Stir this mixture into a pan of the hot oil that you've previously prepared. I
find this to be simply the most logical way to cook the mixture, but you may be
irrational, who am I to know?, and find it preferable to boil it.

Replace the lid and shake the whole thing vigorously to mix everything. When
ready, transfer the veggie mixture to a plate.

Warm the saucepan over medium heat until things bubble up. When ready, add the
noodles and the sauce, and stir for about two minutes. Remove from the heat and
add the vinegar, tamari or soy sauce, miso or other soy sauce. Add the blood
and vegetable mess. Season with a dash of salt and pepper the remaining onion
layers.

**_After Having Swallowed a Bowl of Vampirole_**

*The first bowl of* Vampirole *drools in your mouth like a messy bed raped by the rough rays of sundawn.*

*The blood beast growls and prowls in the first bowl then from the well of your throat it howls to its sleeping fellows, calling for close air support by nightfall.*

*The first drop of the "Febrile Summer Night" Extra Spicy Happy Hour Edition leaping onto the back of my teeth is*

*a wailing chorus of agent-oranged meat-eating corpses-to-be, who's eating who now!, barely hearing my screams above their screams*

*"Hey you, meatlickers, next time treat us bloodsuckers with the respect of the Earth!"*

Use the whisk and add the sauce to the veggie mixture. Mix well. It should be
creamy in consistency. Return the sauce to the saucepan. Heat until it heats
up. Serve in the drooping bowls for a very civilised starter. I have found that
it tastes best with a couple of traditional globs of lean blood in the dish. I
have a recipe for some shumai (home-made veggie dumplings) that go great with
this dish. They are very good with bitter green tea.

*To avoid danger,  
Or too much pleasure,  
Slurp it in quick  
In one fine lick.*
