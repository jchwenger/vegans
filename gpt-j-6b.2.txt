Their reactions, despite being equally enthusiastic, was nevertheless markedly
different. E., for instance, couldn't stop wondering why the onset of their
regimen was so evocative of thrilling and uneasy sexual undertones? T., on the
other hand, struggled to reconcile himself with a growing, shameful and
unavowed fetish for the semen of women who have sucked blood – the fate, so it
would learn, of so many blood vegan males. Neither could have imagined the
radical turn their sex life was about to take.

A few days into the carnivorous regimen of oral and anal blood-sucking (also
referred to as bottom vampirism, even if this is utterly wrong, etymologically
speaking), a completely unexpected thing happened: it seemed to the two vegans
that they had just been licked clean by some sexual entity. Neither of them
recognized that this figure who indulged in a full-sensory relationship with
them, with its sexual and non-sexual components, was other than their partners.
The identity of the new sexual companion was quite impossible to pinpoint. As
it seemed to the latter, both the penetration during oral sex and the rimming
during anal sex represented a one-in-a-million chance, but the fact of the
matter is that it wasn't they who consciously consented to this role-play, but
they who were seduced by it. A fortunate accident, they concluded. The first
indicator that they were dealing with a new sexual environment beyond the
limits of their imagination, an intimacy entirely outside the comfort zone they
had ever explored before was this unexpected outcome.

Most disturbing, it seemed so ordinary to them. They had licked and sucked one
another before in numerous scenes of boundless pleasure. The new scenario,
however, seemed to come without a penis. Both of them were disappointed by the
lack of that particular physical component but, even more, they felt
self-conscious about the lack of male sexual organs or semen. The simplest way
to neutralize their uncertainties was to consummate their relationship through
top/bottom "rape-sucking" or "molest-biting". The seed of this term originates
in the course of time, the fusion of two of our closest relatives, which
ignited, as a by-product, an oral relationship of sadistic and masochistic
undertone.

They came to understand that this relationship, this confrontation with a
figure they couldn't immediately recognize and this sexual engagement with a
level of mutual desire they haven't encountered before, was another poignant
sign, an indication of their well-being in relation to their social groups,
another indication of their progress towards their own modalities of monogamous
and non-monogamous couplings.

In the eyes of their friends and colleagues at work, though, the previous norms
fell by the wayside, as did their couple routine, a fact which wouldn't have
been more apparent had not their friends and colleagues greeted their informed
decision by an unbelievable reaction. It was everything but a guilty
expression. Both of them felt newly freed to take risks, to defy limits, to
expand their capacity of enjoyment to new highs and new lows. Despite their
fondness for monogamy, their urge to be together seemed to be replaced with a
desperate need to escape from any confinement by not willing to compromise on
their romantic preferences. The way they used their new discretion, confidence,
and flexibility seemed to speak more than a mile. An enjoyable yet excruciating
predicament this regimen of carnivorous blood-sucking was, at least for the
long-time pair of vegans.

They experienced their relationships as never before, an increasing need to be
alone and an equally intense desire to commune with their loved ones. Due to
this dynamic sensuality, the nature of their relationship kept changing. Days
spent together seemed to have been replaced by nights of passionate and
intricate fantasies. It went on until their arms, shoulders, and necks were
covered in poisonous pus-like or disgusting substances.

At some point, all the gloom dissipated: The dark cloud that covered their
relationships lifted. They were off their best, but their appetite for blood
remained as strong as ever and their eagerness to feast on the nourishment of
those who had nourished them was only encouraged by their strict nadir of
sexual energy.

When they realized that they wanted to feed on human flesh, they succumbed to
their cannibalistic urges, hiding their fetishes under the pretext of their
beloved vampirism. Let them have their trifling desires! This was a time of
life when everybody needs a vacation.
