## 7.

Everyone was horrified, but they had all fallen in love with this idea,
forgetting all consequences. And so it came to pass that they put everyone to
one side, and themselves to the other. They became hungrier than ever, and they
managed to keep each other alive for several weeks, their mutual memory banks
full of the horrific pasts of the other. Then they changed their minds: given
who they had become, it did not really matter whether they got along with
everyone or not. They felt other and the same. Blood had made them multiple,
parallel and indifferent. This time they spent their time sharing quick-fire
*jeux d'esprit* in foreign languages and speed buying routines in grocery
stores, like normal people, and yet they found that they had become able to
resist all temptations. During their meals, they would invent jokes about last
suppers, about going crazy, about stabbing each other, about shearing off
livers and pancreases, prostate and fallopian tubes, about eloping into the sky
on radiant chariots.
