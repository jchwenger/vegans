In a series of passionate lectures and a hundred confrontations with the
political, religious and ideological situation of their age, they persuaded
themselves that this was absolutely fine – that they were ready for it – and
even pawned their tongue rings in Fleet Street in an effort to give more fuel
to the fire of their conviction, to force themselves never to give up the
fight. These fascinating women took a huge risk, but it paid off, and they
almost immediately felt a surge of vitality from the blood. After many contact
experiments, they realised that given only very short adaptation period, a few
days at most, they could maintain the same blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI and
cardiovascular tonus as someone who lived on animal blood! That was a profound
and deeply unexpected revelation. However, reckless copycats of their method
soon started to die and, unfortunately, as a decentralised lifestyle contagion
event, also known as a Standalone Complex in pandemic parlance, was a disease
that most European countries did not have much experience with before the Black
Death of 1346, they had to bury their discoveries as well as themselves in a
dim and gloomy basement in Helsinki and live forever in hiding, digging tunnels
and galleries underground connecting all the great cultural centres of Europe.
The sisters, sustained by their miraculous practices, lived on for hundreds of
years, until their former pupil and later informant, Charles Darwin,
mysteriously died during the Long Depression of 1873-1896, giving the location
of their hideout away to his wife Emma, a derelict cave at I Am Not in the
Least Afraid of Death Mews, West Brompton.
