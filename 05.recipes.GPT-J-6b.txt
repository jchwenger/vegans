### 5.

Being methodical and a bit nerdy, they started by thinking about recipes. Here
are a few of them.

*All dairy products are assumed to be of human or plant origin, or synthetic.*

**Blood and Other Potatoes**

Peel and thinly slice potatoes, as well as accompaniments according to taste,
such as strawberries, ripe pears, watermelons, capsicum or even onions.
Thoroughly mix with your, or your children's, blood protein solution (created
by adding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) to tepid
water and mashing the mixture maniacally through a tea strainer or sieve). Cook
in an iron cauldron until everything becomes one hæmoglobinous mass that will
hold shapes. Serve with vegan mayonnaise.

**Thirsty Naples Chick Pizzazz (not a pizza!)**

Marinate your freshly blood-seeded kidney-shaped pasta (blend the
aforementioned blood protein solution with semolina and sunflower oil) with
carnivorous plant flower pollen, avocado zest, and distilled bile. Serve with
tomato sauce, garlic, black pepper, basil and parmigiano.

**Ides of March Salad**

*(The original Roman recipe requires blood from the recently deceased from
unnatural causes, but in modern times standard household blood is commonly used
as a replacement. The same goes for the feathers, traditionally from SPQR
eagles, but in current urban contexts more often than not pigeon or even
sparrow feathers are used. The International Vegan Federation consider the
latter permissible if collected on the ground without harm or disturbance to
the birds.)*

The devil, as always, is in the dressing: dried blood flakes bleached in
nocciola cream, fig juice, olive oil, garlic paste and white wine vinegar.
Alternatively add cherry tomatoes, capers, cashew or coconut mozzarella, fig
feta, sliced, roasted and crushed feathers, or, for the seafood version,
shiitake cuttlefish, oyster mushroom octopus, or potato & kelp prawns. Don't
forget to sprinkle the salad with more blood flakes and potato slices before
serving.

**New York Bloodcake**

Dissolve semi-sweet or regular cake mix into blood and tears (measure a few
teaspoons once the cake mix has blended into the blood). Add finely chopped
fresh herbs, nuts, and dried blood fruits according to the season. Cook in the
oven until it looks semi wet, then gild it with milk icing.

Recommended blood fruits:

- Crimson Pineapple (Equatorial New Transylvania): the juice is often used as
  broth by cannibals
- Clotty Cantaloupe (also tropical, mostly found in Kazakhstan and Mongolia)
- Dracula's Plum (Mediterranean): not technically a blood fruit, but imitates
  the taste of blood to deter predators
- Wounded Blackcurrants (Balkans): the main ingredient for the eponymous
  'wounded soda', that uses fermented juice from these berries as well as
  plasma from the elderly, very popular in Sarajevo and Zagreb
- Robespierre Apple (France, Belgium and Switzerland): a breed developed by
  Benedictine monks as pastime during the Terror of '93

**Hamlet's Omelet**

Using your own uncle's blood, or, if not available, standard household blood,
poach a couple of (chia, flax or mung beans) eggs in a stone pan on a platform
before a castle. Add a dash of milk (princess preferred, but any loving partner
will do), pepper, nutmeg, poisoned earwax, salt to taste. Once they are wiggly,
smash them into a cheap, moist, high-protein and thoroughly nerve-wracking
omelet.

***

**Cao Cao's Death Noodles**

Prepare your dandan sauce as usual, replacing the pork mince with a generous
dollop of stir-fried fermented blood. Season your noodles with your favourite
greens, scallions, coriander, soft-boiled (chia, flax or mung beans) eggs,
sesame oil, and light soy sauce, or some greasy hair tofu (best if fried
beforehand with dark soy sauce, caster sugar and Shaoxing wine).

***

**Raw Blood Popsicles**

These are rather tasty and harmless, especially after a good few hours of
bloodletting. Urban dwellers' veins may contain environmental pollutants, so
consider carefully what you ingest.

For crisper results, it is advised to let the blood cool down before freezing
it:

- Summer blood: 14-15 °C
- Winter blood: 8-10 °C
