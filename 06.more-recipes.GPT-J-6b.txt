## 6.

Being methodical and a bit nerdy, they started by thinking about recipes. Here
are a few of them.[^2]

**Black Pudding**

Ingredients

- 2 litres of fresh human blood
- 500g of diced sea coconut fat, slightly sweated
- 250g of sliced onions, finely chopped and gently sweated
- 2 heaped tbsp of oatmeal, soaked in water overnight
- 1 heaped tsp of white pepper
- 1 heaped tbsp of salt
- 1 heaped tsp of ground mixed spice (such as coriander, cumin & ginger)
- 500 ml of double cream (Teat Treasures or Maternal Love are both great
  brands, but the bounty of any sound woman's breast will do)

Equipment

- 1 large pan
- Natural sausage placenta casings (which you need to soak overnight beforehand)
- A funnel
- A sieve
- A large tray
- String

After extraction, sieve the blood, into a large container, to remove any clots
or any impurities. Add the sweated coconut fat and the fried onions to the
blood. Mix in well. Then stir in the oatmeal, white pepper, salt, spice and
double cream. When the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, it's time to fill the
casings. Tie a knot on over one end of a casing – leaving a long length of
string as a "tail". Pull the other end over the nozzle of your funnel. Using a
ladle, pour the mixture into the funnel. This will be messy, so perform the
entire operation over a tray to catch any overflow. Don't overfill the casing –
puddings expand as they cook. You need to leave 5-7cm at the top. The funnel
can become clogged. Use a chopstick or something similar to clear any blockage.
Take the tail of the piece of string and use it to tie a second knot in the
other end of the casing. You should have a nice U-shaped pudding. Complete
filling the rest of the casings. Bring a large pan filled with two-thirds of
unsalted water to the boil and then turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer.
Add each pudding to the water. Prick the pudding occasionally times with a
needle. If a brown liquid comes out, the pudding is done. This should take
about 20 minutes. Leave the pudding to cool and then slice and serve (fresh
blood coulis is popular but optional).

**Blood Soup**

Ingredients

- Two liters of fresh human blood
- 2 med-large onions, roughly chopped
- 1 med-large leek, chopped
- 1 med-large potato, roughly chopped
- 1 med-large carrot, roughly chopped
- 80 grams of oatmeal, soaked overnight
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1/3 bunch of lemongrass, crushed
- 2 tbsp of peanuts, soaked overnight
- 2 tbsp of coriander seeds, soaked overnight
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 tbsp of dulse and miso paste
- 2 generous tbsp of tamarind concentrate

Equipment

- A large pan
- A saw-tooth spoon
- An oven
- Large bowls
- A thermometer
- A sieve
- A large container
- A measuring cup

Set oven to 180°C. Using the back of a ladle, a nail or a chopstick, start
piercing an inch or so hole in the bottom of the container. This is where the
soup will catch and this will ensure that no clump of blood go to waste. Drain
and rinse the blood off your hands, and, without licking your fingers, dry the
juiciness a little by grabbing blobs of material with your fingers and
squeezing some of its life out. Start by heating the blood – but don't overheat
it. The temperature shouldn't be hotter than that which you would use to boil
infant milk.

**_A note on Blood Soup_**

*The recents attacks against the concept of using yourself as nourishment, even
in sensible, middle-of-the-road cases where the 'negative' effects remain
minimal, are based on somewhat stretchy arguments. There are people who have
had a blood transfusion since the start of the art with no ill effects.
Besides, would even the most dedicated occultist positivist be able to defend
that getting such a treatment is not such a good idea if, following it
carefully, one can be guaranteed still to live in 100 years' time? Even if that
is one's innermost desire? Maybe those critics should remember that a blood
solution to health problems like the one we propound is what can be called a
"natural fasting product", a time-honoured ascetic practice and a pathway to
spiritual and scientific enlightenment.*

*An additional and important note to be made is that while we – vegans of course
– are the only people truly aware of the genesis of our bizarre habits, we
would like to keep the wit and creativity in our work intact, mostly by using
rabid rambling and unexpected metaphors. Thus we hope to enlarge our crowd, and
get more test subjects.*

Slowly bring the blood to a boil, then take it off the heat. Mix all the
vegetables in a large bowl. Put the oatmeal in another bowl and combine it with
the salt, garlic, lemongrass, coriander seeds, peanuts, dulse and miso paste
and tamarind concentrate. Pour the blood over the mixture. Mix well. Pour the
mixture into the container again, returning it to the oven. Bake for 2-3 hours.
Let cool and then refrigerate. Serve in a variety of ways – spicy, mild,
savoury, sweet, sweet and sour, thin or thick. My favourite way to eat the soup
is with raw onion, garlic, peanut butter, roti and Slit-Throat apples.

**Kotteri Hakata Vampirole with Tagaruikko Natural Meatpacking Plant
Vegetables**

*freely adapted from the book by Matayoshi & Shimura*

Ingredients

- 1 cup of clotless, precooked minced blood
- 1 pound of firm tofu
- 1 cup of cooked yellow or red rice (other indeterminate colours are
  tolerated)
- 250 ml of vegetable oil
- 250 ml of cashew cream
- 1 cup of chopped leeks, fleeced
- 1 cup of dried mushrooms, softened in warm water overnight, chopped
- 1 cup of shredded fresh greens or cooked cabbage (green, red, yellow or
  black)
- 1 cup of chopped spring onions
- 1 cup of tamari (or other soy sauce)
- 1 cup of chopped kale
- 1 cup of chopped carrot
- 1 cup of chopped celery
- 1/2 cup of uncooked buckwheat noodles
- 1/4 cup of ginger (large knobs)
- 1/4 cup of coarsely ground corn
- 1/4 cup of cornstarch
- 1/4 cup of ground sesame seeds
- 1/2 cup of shiro miso (white miso)
- 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup of sugar

Equipment

- Baking tray
- A whisk
- A food processor
- A 1-gallon cooking vessel
- A saucepan
- A large pan
- A heavy grater
- A plate
- A rolling pin

To be honest, these are all made from a single trip to the grocery store. Fresh
yellow onions, fresh red tomatoes, and two different kinds of mushrooms were
all purchased the same day. I'm going to use the Tagaruikko Natural Meatpacking
Plant vegetables as the backbone (I do not know when it shut down in the first
place, but it has been derelict for many years, I'm sure you also went there
for illegal raves as a teenager, and now their produce market is definitely the
best out there). After the liquid in the seasoning has been poured in, heat the
oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Chop up all the solid ingredients and
the broth. Add them to the pan and let simmer for 1 hour. The dish should be a
tomato red colour. Add the remaining liquids and simmer again for another hour.
Fill the cooking container with rice. Alternatively, pour everything into your
makeshift vessel and whisk until frothy and a uniform colour. Jams works too.
Grate the ginger and add to the bowl. Replace the lid and shake the whole thing
vigorously to mix everything. When ready, use a plate and transfer the veggie
mixture to the plate. Warm the saucepan over medium heat until it has bubbled
up. When it does, stir the sauce for about 2 minutes. Remove sauce from heat
and add the vinegar, sugar and sesame seeds. Season with a dash of salt and
pepper.

**_After Having Swallowed a Bowl of Vampirole_**

*The first bowl of* Vampirole *drools in your mouth like a messy bed raped by the rough rays of sundawn.*

*The blood beast growls and prowls in the first bowl then from the well of your throat it howls to its sleeping fellows, calling for close air support by nightfall.*

*The first drop of the "Febrile Summer Night" Extra Spicy Happy Hour Edition leaping onto the back of my teeth is*

*a bidden chorus of agent-oranged meat-eating corpses-to-be, no longer eating, barely hearing my screams above their screams*

*"Hey you, meatlickers, next time treat us bloodsuckers with the respect of the Earth!"*

Use the whisk and add the sauce to the veggie mixture. Mix well. It should be
creamy in consistency. Return the sauce to the saucepan. Heat until it heats
up. Serve in the drooping bowls for a very civilized starter. I have found that
it tastes best with a couple of traditional globs of lean blood in the dish. I
have a recipe for some shumai (homemade veggie dumplings) that go great with
this dish. They are very good with sweet green tea.

*To avoid danger,  
Or too much pleasure,  
Slurp it in quickly   
As fast as you can.*
