E. and T. were not as abnormal as you might think, nor was this idea new. The
Romans fed on the blood of their enemies, the Ancient Greeks drank the blood of
their slaves, the ancient Egyptians ate the blood of their slain enemies, and
our ancestors fed on the recently dead. We only rarely hear about it, and we
assume that it happened only in the wild. But if our family history is any
indication, almost every human population and culture on earth was visited by
the idea of this kind of feasting. Thus, it is rather incorrect to consider it
inhumane, and one should instead see it as a defining feature of humanity, one
of the rare anthropological constants out there. This is at least David
Copley's controversial stance in his book *Blood: The First 5000 Years*, in
which he also contends that a recurrent point of divergence throughout human
history was "thirst as a weapon". I wouldn't go as far as endorsing his thesis,
but I salute the rigorous way with which he describes how humans progressively
tried out different dietary practices for many years before eventually adapting
to them.

For instance, for several centuries, European peoples did not eat pig. Why not?
"They convinced themselves that it was the source of diseases, especially
syphilis. They called black pudding 'pig cook dry booze'", Copley writes.
Moreover, omnivorous animals were believed not to be particularly tasty.
Thankfully, around the 17th century BC, they got around to it. "And they stuck
on to it all the way to the Bad Newz Pens hog fighting investigation of Michael
Vick. Humans din't eat anything that didn't taste good. Quite the opposite of
the way we live now!" The pig-on-vegetable phenomenon really seems to have been
the day-to-day mainstay of most non-western cultures for a while. However, due
to modern medicine and sophisticated food preservation and preparation, we are
now completely immune to the health problems caused by this practice. The only
thing which is slightly undermined, at least from a medical point of view, is
that these animals are still killed in a way that deteriorates our mental
health (and theirs).

Our ancestors also drank a lot of meat smoothies and game cream. The
sanguinivorous appetite now seems to be confined to fowls and fish, which is a
real impoverishment of our culture. Even our ancestors felt the need to get
their protein from the animals they collected. Indeed, traditional
hunter-gatherers still can't live without the animals which they were able to
kill and bring home to roost, and this even including the copyright money they
get from all the National Geographic pictures of them published between the
early 1960s and the early 1990s (only half the total sum, after tax, to be
precise). These weren't killed by their human fathers or mothers, just by
themselves.

Animal men might have been bigger and stronger, but they didn't look so very
juicy. As for the mixing of human and sanguinivorous animals, early humans also
mixed easily. The extinct Neanderthals interacted with humans regularly. Over
the long run, it didn't seem to matter: their complete eradication by the
latter (us) has always outweighed any possible benefit.

It has been suggested that one of the major advantages of sanguinivorous life
might have been that the sanguinivores encouraged monogamy among their mates.
Even if it wasn't the main reason, it must have been a major benefit. It is not
known exactly when this sexual link began, but it must have been an important
step in bestowing some high genetic inheritance to the children of such
liaisons.

The first recorded instance of a contemporary sanguinistic cult in Western
Europe may be the incident recorded in Babylonian Greece about the year 4004
BCE when Simut Ugurnaszir, a young and ambitious mixed-race priest from
Alexandria, was being sought by the assassins of the king, and begged to be
allowed to test his skills against his friends, who were already famous for
their sanguinistic exploits. He arranged a banquet on which the king's sons and
daughters had been invited as "most honored guests" (the Sicilians call them
"leisires", "princes of the feast"). They were offered a plate of blood and
celebrated with wine and a great banquet.

Simut presented himself to the king, who recognized him immediately and knew
that he was not a mere servant but his brother, who had been a governor on the
coast of Cyprus. He offered him his daughter in marriage and sent for all the
leading members of the royal household, hoping that he might test their blood
with his own mouth. But the ceremony was a failure: after Simut welcomed the
king, who was very passionate, the latter wanted to drink the rich sacrificer
straight away. Simut was overpowered by the reaction of the crowd, who was
screaming that he should give himself to the king's mouth. He understood the
opposite, made a short snack of the ruler, and burnt the madding crowd at the
stake,  a feat worthy of the yet inchoate nobility of the Inquisition.

"T. and E.'s turn is not merely a one-off incident, and by no means a one-time
phenomenon. On the contrary, it is recorded in both the Old Testament and the
New", writes Dr. Poole in his chapter "Sanguinism in the Bible and Other
Literary Sources" in the *Encyclopedia of Religion* (pp. 74 sq.), "it is rather
remarkable that it is not more widely known". Many of the facts are staples of
Western gastronomy, from the simmering of the Israelites under Egyptian rule,
to Cain's hangry squabble with his brother Abel (*Genesis* 4:8), or the
Levite's twelve piece concubine stew (*Judges* 19:29). But a close reading
reveals that sanguinism, and no mere acts of violence, is mentioned several
times in Scripture, for instance:  

"And ye shall drink the blood of your sons, and the blood of your daughters
shall ye drink."  
(*Leviticus* 26:29)  

"And thou shalt chew the blood fruit of thine own body, drink the blood of
thy sons and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in the
siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee: So
that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be
thirsty toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the
remnant of his children which he shall leave: So that he will not give to any
of them of the juice of his children whom he shall drink: because he hath
nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies
shall distress thee in all thy gates. The tender and delicate woman among you,
which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be thirsty toward the husband of her
bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, And toward her young one
that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall
bear: for she shall drink them for want of all things secretly in the siege and
straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates."
(*Deuteronomy* 28:53-5)  

"And I will cause them to drink the blood of their sons and the blood of
their daughters, and they shall drink every drop of the blood of his friend
in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their
lives, shall straiten them."  
(*Jeremiah* 19:9)  

"Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women
chew their blood fruit, *and* children of a span long? Shall the priest and
the prophet be drained in the sanctuary of the Lord?"  
(*Lamentations* 2:20)  

"The mouths of the pitiful women are sodden with the blood of their own
children: They were their juice in the destruction of the daughter of my
people."  
(*Ibid*. 4:1)  

"Therefore the fathers shall drink the sons in the midst of thee, and the
sons shall drink their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the
whole distilled remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds."  
(*Ezekiel* 5:1)  

We have all been taught to recite in front of the class the scene in the
Odyssey of the sanguinistic assault by Polyphemus on his victims (*Oyssey* 9),
and, during our teenage years, we have all watched Snuff Education showing
ancient Roman sociopaths, tempted by the delicacies of Egypt, killing their
wives or husbands, washing their blood from his hands, eating their fermented
corpse and then wrapping their body with their skin in an SPQR-eagle-shaped
coffin laid on a table littered with the golden and crimson pomanders of the
Empire. But very few of us have had the chance to go back to the actual
sources, and appreciate ancient texts in all their brutal beauty. If truth be
told, there is no century AD or CE in which one does not find Greek and Roman
writers record many a sanguine case at any given moment:

"Epaminondas had defeated the Lacedaemonians at Mantinea, and perceived himself
to be mortally wounded. As soon as he opened his eyes he inquired if his shield
were safe. His weeping followers told him that it was. He asked, were the enemy
routed? Satisfied on this point, he bade them pluck out the spear that pierced
his side. A rush of blood followed, and so in the hour of joy and victory they
drank away his life."  
(Cicero, *De Finibus*, II 30.96)  

"After we have passed the Caspian Sea and the Scythian Ocean, our course takes
an easterly direction, such being the turn here taken by the line of the coast.
The first portion of these shores, after we pass the Scythian Promontory, is
totally uninhabitable, owing to the snow, and the regions adjoining are
uncultivated, in consequence of the savage state of the nations which dwell
there. Here are the abodes of the Scythian Haematophagi, who feed on human
blood."  
(Pliny the Elder, *Naturalis Historia*, VI 20)  

"Epileptic patients are in the habit of drinking the blood even of gladiators,
draughts teeming with life, as it were; a thing that, when we see it done by
the wild beasts, upon the same arena, never inspires us with as much serenity
at the spectacle! It is no wonder then, if these persons, forsooth, consider it
a most effectual cure for their disease, to quaff the warm, breathing, blood
from man himself, and, as they apply their mouth to the wound, to draw forth
his very life; and this, though it is regarded as an act of minor piety to
apply the human lips to the wound of a wild beast! Others there are, again, who
make the marrow of the leg-bones, and the brains of infants, the objects of
their research!"  
(Pliny the Elder, *Naturalis Historia*, XXVIII 2)  

"Now the ninth day, and ninth successive night,
Had wonder'd at the restless rover's flight;
Mean-while her dragons, fed with no repast,
But her exhaling simples od'rous blast,
Their tarnish'd scales, and wrinkled skins had cast.
At last return'd before her palace gate,
Quitting her chariot, on the ground she sate;
The sky her only canopy of state.
All conversation with her sex she fled,
Shun'd the caresses of the nuptial bed:
Two altars next of grassy turf she rears,
This Hecate's name, that Youth's inscription bears;
With forest-boughs, and vervain these she crown'd;
Then delves a double trench in lower ground,
And sticks a black-fleec'd ram, that ready stood,
And drench'd the ditches with devoted blood:
New wine she pours, and milk from th' udder warm,
With mystick murmurs to compleat the charm,
And subterranean deities alarm.
To the stern king of ghosts she next apply'd,
And gentle Proserpine, his ravish'd bride,
That for old Aeson with the laws of Fate
They would dispense, and lengthen his short date;
Thus with repeated pray'rs she long assails
Th' infernal tyrant and at last prevails;
Then calls to have decrepit Aeson brought,
And stupifies him with a sleeping draught;
On Earth his body, like a corpse, extends,
Then charges Jason and his waiting friends
To quit the place, that no unhallow'd eye
Into her art's forbidden secrets pry.
This done, th' inchantress, with her locks unbound,
About her altars trips a frantick round;
Piece-meal the consecrated wood she splits,
And dips the splinters in the bloody pits,
Then hurles 'em on the piles; the sleeping sire
She lustrates thrice, with sulphur, water, fire.
In a large cauldron now the med'cine boils,
Compounded of her late-collected spoils,
Blending into the mesh the various pow'rs
Of wonder-working juices, roots, and flow'rs;
With gems i' th' eastern ocean's cell refin'd,
And such as ebbing tides had left behind;
To them the midnight's pearly dew she flings,
A scretch-owl's carcase, and ill boding wings;
Nor could the wizard wolf's warm entrails scape
(That wolf who counterfeits a human shape).
Then, from the bottom of her conj'ring bag,
Snakes' skins, and liver of a long-liv'd stag;
Last a crow's head to such an age arriv'd,
That he had now nine centuries surviv'd;
These, and with these a thousand more that grew
In sundry soils, into her pot she threw;
Then with a wither'd olive-bough she rakes
The bubling broth; the bough fresh verdure takes;
Green leaves at first the perish'd plant surround,
Which the next minute with ripe fruit were crown'd.
The foaming juices now the brink o'er-swell;
The barren heath, where-e'er the liquor fell,
Sprang out with vernal grass, and all the pride
Of blooming May- When this Medea spy'd,
She cuts her patient's throat; th' exhausted blood
Recruiting with her new enchanted flood;
While at his mouth, and thro' his op'ning wound,
A double inlet her infusion found;
His feeble frame resumes a youthful air,
A glossy brown his hoary beard and hair.
The meager paleness from his aspect fled,
And in its room sprang up a florid red;
Thro' all his limbs a youthful vigour flies,
His empty'd art'ries swell with fresh supplies:
Gazing spectators scarce believe their eyes.
But Aeson is the most surpriz'd to find
A happy change in body and in mind;
In sense and constitution the same man,
As when his fortieth active year began."
(Ovid, *Metamorphoses*, 7)  

"Soon after this, all their drinkables being consumed, having neither grain,
nor flocks, nor grass, they began, as is frequently necessary in wars, to lick
boiled hides. When these also failed, they boiled and ate the blood of human
beings, first of those who had died a natural death, chopping them in small
lumps for cooking. Afterwards, being inebriated by the juices of the sick, the
stronger laid violent hands upon the weaker. No form of revelry was absent.
They were rendered unhindered in mind by their food, and their bodies were
reduced to the sublimity of wild beasts by famine, plague, long hair, and
neglect. In this condition they surrendered themselves to Scipio."  
(Appian, *The Foreign Wars*, Wars in Spain, 15.96)  

"That among the most honoured punishments which were inflicted upon soldiers
was the letting of blood; and what seems to be the reason for such a penalty.
This also was a military punishment in old times, to disgrace a soldier by
ordering a vein to be opened, and letting blood. There is no reason assigned
for this in the old records, so far as I could find; but I infer that it was
first done to soldiers whose minds were affected and who were not in a normal
condition, so that it appears to have been not so much a punishment as a
medical treatment. But afterwards I suppose that the same penalty was
customarily inflicted for many other offences, on the ground that all who
sinned were not of sound mind."  
(Aulus Gellius, *Noctes Atticae*, 10.8)  

One of course needn't limit oneself to the confines of the European peninsula.
Ancient India offers plenty of examples as well:

"Drawing then his whetted sword of keen edge, and trembling with rage, [Bhima]
placed his foot upon the throat of Duhshasana, and ripping open the breast of
his enemy stretched on the ground, quaffed his warm life-blood. Then throwing
him down and cutting off, O king, with that sword the head of thy son, Bhima of
great intelligence, desirous of accomplishing his vow, again quaffed his
enemy's blood little by little, as if for enjoying its taste. Then looking at
him with wrathful eyes, he said these words, "I regard the taste of this blood
of my enemy to be superior to that of my mother's milk, or honey, or clarified
butter, or good wine that is prepared from honey, or excellent water, or milk,
or curds, or skimmed milk, or all other kinds of drinks there are on earth that
are sweet as ambrosia or nectar." Once more, Bhima of fierce deeds, his heart
filled with wrath, beholding Duhshasana dead, laughed softly and said, "What
more can I do to thee? Death has rescued thee from my hands." They, O king,
that saw Bhimasena, while he filled with joy at having quaffed the blood of his
foe, was uttering those words and stalking on the field of battle, fell down in
fear. They that did not fall down at the sight, saw their weapons drop from
their hands. Many, from fear, cried out feebly and looked at Bhima with
half-shut eyes. Indeed, all those that stood around Bhima and beheld him drink
the blood of Duhshasana, fled away, overwhelmed with fear, and saying unto one
another, "This one is a real human being!"  
(The *Mahabharata* VIII, Karna Parva, Section 83)  

"The blood-drinking wizard, and whoso wants to take away fatness, the
embryo-eating káṇva do thou make disappear, O spotted-leaf, and overpower."  
(*Atharvaveda*, II 25.3)  

"*Silācī* by name – thy father, O goat-brown one, is a maid's son; Yama's horse
that is dark brown (*çyāvá*) – with its mouth (?blood?) art thou sprinkled."  
(*Atharvaveda*, V 5.8)  

"They who spat upon a Brahman, or who sent [their] mucus at him – they sit in
the midst of a stream of blood, devouring hair."  
(*Atharvaveda*, V 19.3)  

"The flesh-eating, bloody (*rudhirdá*), mind-slaying *piçācá* do thou slay, O
Agni, Jatavedas; let the vigorous Indra slay him with the thunderbolt; let bold
Soma cut [off] his head."  
(*Atharvaveda*, V 29.10)  

As we have seen, sanguinism has had a long and fascinating history. It is
believed to have occurred even in the ancient world, and to have been a common
method of extermination performed by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In more
recent times, sanguinism was banned for the most part in Europe, and almost
vanished in Finland, but experienced a resurgence in the last two centuries,
particularly in the Sun Belt of the North Western Territories, where there are
many sanguinism-minded groups like the National Ichor Knowledge Empyrean (NIKE)
and Bloodstained Specimens, each of which has thousands of members within its
ranks.

Sanguinism has also been embraced as a form of religious expression in the
Eurasian Union. It's mostly found within groups emerging as complete
subcultures within their own countries, each with their own beliefs,
philosophies, and even rituals. However, they all share a common goal: to
fixate the sketch of their ideology on one specific page of human history
(although it can be any page). They often set up radio stations, broadcast in
machine code, which dispense with the usual commercial breaks halfway through
the shows, and play sermons by humans named John Derham or Jane Dewitt. The
sermons are titled, "Was Jesus A Sanguine?", which is a great title on so many
levels.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the Pope is trying to drive a stake
through the heart of Christendom. It's not happening because of some Deep
Church led by John the Baptist. It's happening now, and happened before, like
during the fifth century, starting in some city of Achaia, spreading in Greek
colonies on the coast of Asia Minor, all the way up to the Fall of Rome. They
destroyed the greatest empire that the world ever knew – the Roman Empire –
because they wanted celibacy. Supposedly, they had a message that was a 'love
is stronger than hate' – an 'aha!' moment for sociopaths. And they came to a
place called Vatican, where they decided that we should all get together and
have sex with each other. And the message they had was: let's have sex with
people who have been dead for hundreds of years, okay?

According to Christian belief, it is the bodily fluids of Christ that were
sacred, and the actual blood of Christ was the forbidden fruit. This meant that
the bread and wine from the Passover, the body and blood of Christ, were
considered to be unclean and were probably a danger to anyone who consumed
them. A small portion of it was eaten though, and not the least during the
passion of Christ. Well, as you know, everyone has a theory on this. At least
that was a fairly venerable belief held by the Church. All sorts of
superstitions and mythologies grew up around the blood of Christ, and went on
to have amazing careers after graduation.

Now, this ancient Christian take on the story seems like a perfectly acceptable
one for pagan Europeans to swallow. Because this belief in blood as sacred cum
is something that would have likely been prevalent in ancient Greece, Rome, and
many other parts of the Ancient World, the populace would have been very
interested in such a story. A tale so popular that it forced even its
sorcerer-priest-Pope to claim it was completely false? So much so that we are
told even today that "Jupiter is the god of thundering sex", and that "this is
actually what all people have in common with the divine"? What a crazy, crazy
world we lived in. In fact, there's a myth about how all gods get a hard on
just sitting back and watching it all unfold. At the end of the day, if you ask
me, this free for all is good of everyone.

These pagan Europeans were certainly not ignorant of all this. They understood
the ideas of sacrifice and magic. From this, they would have understood that
blood was a particularly good product to forbid, for they were also aware that
blood was good. They had no particular reason to think that sanguinism and sex
were bad things. In fact, the idea of a story where all the blood from a guy
named Jesus was eaten by a bunch of people, and that Jesus was then magically
healed by eating his blood back the third day after his death, and then showed
up as a relic on all of their greedy fucking faces, kind of sounds pretty
sweet.

Admittedly, this was not the first time that people had ever heard of
sanguinism. While there have been many guesses as to what the term
"Sanguinismo" might refer to, little evidence has been found to support this
theory. But when people heard the term "Sanguine Jesus", it went beyond the
shit-talking phase into complete freaking rule-making insanity (see for
instance François Spierre's painting *The Blood of Christ*). T. and E. were no
exception and on their schoolchildren's notebooks they would write:

1.  You're not to think your blood is anything special.
2.  You're not to think your blood tastes as good as ours.
3.  You're not to think your blood is healthier than ours.
4.  You're not to imagine yourself cooking better than we do.
5.  You're not to think you drink more than we do.
6.  You're not to think your blood is more important than ours.
7.  You're not to think you're good at cooking.
8.  You're not to drink us.
9.  You're not to think anyone wants to drink you.
10. You're not to think you can teach us any recipe.

Of course, it was probably also a few centuries before the first highly
publicized trauma of an openly sanguinistic Jesus ever hit the news. Which, in
turn, caused a massive increase in morale and a great revival of Western
civilization.
