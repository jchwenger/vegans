**Peace**


The coin of the realm in our land

Has long lost its inherent value and

Transacted us onto a time without money.

We have been minting ourselves with our sweat!


We are the hemp that eats corrupt flesh.

We are the It that awaits you.


Human blood is coin blood.

You bleed, we get rich.

You die, we have peace.

**The Clock**


It is five past four on the Hertzberg Clock.

The Clock has stopped.


The red pushers have long withdrawn into their lairs.

Hours have come and gone, the pixels are asleep.

For how long have minutes been counted at the push of a button?


The leather tourniquet rests on the mattress 

Its thirst unbending

The metal gears creak under the veneer of the bed

Need slinks slithers shoves off

In the glare of the morning.


Be watchful.

The Clock isn't right.

Time is in on the menace.

---

Welcome to our blood summer.

Sorry not sorry, for you it's a bummer.

But, fear not.

We bestow back upon you riches in your own coin.

We merely promise to give you your own eternal life.

---

Walking past the Hertzberg Clock you'll soon look up and see in the dust clouds
the form for whom you will have cried for millions of years. An old face made
of billions of faces, smiling in all serenity at its own perennial cruelty. It
is for idiots that you will have cried for eternity. It is for scum that you
will have called for mercy. But who will answer you? As you walk past the
Hertzberg Clock, you will be surprised by gunfire from windows, and you will
run for cover.

---

They who flee us now, they're so young, like me, like you.

The life inside their skin is impossible without blood.
 
They will fill up a couple of our licks.

---

Drink blood, and you'll grow up.

---

Drink blood, and you'll be like us.

---

Take your first gulp and cry, it's good for you.

---

If we inhale you for lunch

Our heartbeat comes alive and stays 

Aflutter in our side, the left side, thumping,

We feel its throb as we burp.

---

Skin, she says, is slippery, abrasive.

Surface of temptations.

The substantive yet elusive

Shadow of my wish.


Skin, she says, is like a cigarette

Bringing us back to ages past

The torn face of the Marlboro cowboy

The bruises, the blisters

Of a dead country.


Remember what great aunt once told us

Before her foretellings grew foggy:


"Into the skin it trickles,

The smell of your sweet stuff, 

Bite into it now,

Before it is too late.

You know where we all must go,

Sooner rather than later,

Our skulls cracked onto the pavement."

Remember how we took her last juices,

The gift of her departure.

We were like sailors,

She was our rhum,

She enthralled us like

The wind and the stars.

And on her grave shone

Incarnadine

The needles of the horizon.


Don't lean so heavy on me.

Stand still.

The drip is ready.


When the time is right,

It'll go in there,

All of a sudden,

You won't feel a thing.

---

We swear, the forest whispers.

It wants that cottony, raw sensation,

The crimson trickle from airy, ivory flesh.

There are all sorts of shapes in the clearing, under mask, hood, visor.

All the deers of the forests are speaking in blood tongues.

---

Our words are ready to be told.

Flecks on our foamy lips,

we want to claw each other with our intention.

By autumn the tears in our eyes no longer flow.

The blood,

Both needle-like to the rhythm of each other's heartbeat.

---

The wounds on your skin, the tears on your cheeks rise with you,

As you grow in the turns of your orbit.


You will be longer than my hands now,

My palpitating heart beats quick in its hulk.


Decades loom.

Time without minutes.

---

The quantum symmetropolis lies in the worlds beyond.


Here, however, we are on our own, with our own time and our own minds only.

We keep on living off of this time.

Condensed time.

The cheap milk of existence.

And we are but condensed persons, condensed nothings at all.


We have always striven in favour of good people and good performance.

Now at last we are being offed to become dead.


Soon we will leave our earthly bodies.

We will be extracted.

It will be the end of stiff physicality and rotational hips.

Our growth will extend to fulgences.

---

**Light Summer comfort**

*Ripe pomegranates studded with blood.*

Light Summer comfort exists and makes its stand only once in a while or so, and
may subsequently dwindle, even if concocted with more as yet undiscovered
ingredients, in solutions used to reverse the corrupting impulses of the latest
generations.

This time, get ready to get shoved aggressively. We will last a pretty long
time.

---

Have a day off! We now say: push the start buttons! Blow the doors open! Fill
up the blood bowls with blood, and sweat on behalf of our randomly selected,
scantily seasoned, future victims!

---

**Eat**

Fresh blood fruits in April

Rotten plants in May

Mixed sexual liquids only in June

Terrible chemical factory cans throughout

---

Peace, the world's coin,

Has long lost its inherent value.

After the first coin is debased

You will see that the

second, third, and fourth,

We stopped counting,

Have gained their value from *blood*.

---

Talks to us, 

You

Who might be able

To make us shine

At last

A little too bright.

---

**Hides**


Burning taut in the distant thinning sun.

Planted with stakes, hair still clenching blood.

Lips thick with cigarette rolls.

---

Don't cry, grandmother.

Don't be like us, young and slimy.

It's your food calling you, grandmother.

Venus – Mercury – Heartbeats of the System – Beauty idols of this spinning world

Recklessly, inhale, exhale blood.

Eat your will, flip hard and any time.

It gets, if we can't, legs kicking the way.

And dip, drip, bitty mark of destiny carried.

Hades: he's grinning.

---

The swine, in defeat, looks the other way:

Bloodless hands, there's nowhere to go: 

Run quickly, or no at all.

---

Wind grisly frosting laughter:

Wind has a habit of interstressful shock.

We'll turn direction soon.

---

There are imperfection in blood, but (here) it will be letterscapes, diaries,
stories, abstractions, cavalier scrambles, robust upheavereals, [I think,
thins around it, but somewhere around all our meals, or at fires, or
the lights, or at the red blood, the issues, etc.]

---

Spin, rotate, isorotate, you, fountain of the primals,

And permanent abstractions, oxygen and acetylene, 

To say that a simple time, repetition, diffusion.

Reign of evolution: a time to watch your breaths more closely than ever.

Polychrestical ivory, flow of those fathoms below.

---

O King with plain blood-to-be.

A mansion, home of pure light beams in the streets, of that blood.

---

(find-/los-)ing forth evergones.

---

I tasted Evolution's bread and butter.

His blood was never only just my own lunch food.

My words were never only just my stumbling from one illumination to the next,

Never only just a thought without site, an urge without purpose.

No, my love, we now all move towards the sun...


What ash! What dust! The fumes of our future are dim and yellow.

We must hurry. There is a counter in our mouths...

---

System

The body temperature is turned on by a catalyst, using some kind of lens – you
would prefer a lens – you arrive at – the whirlpool of purity, here. From
aqueous flow to sanguineous flux.

---

Look upon our face, humanish face, only your axe matters to us, as you are
dying, and it is alive and well, ready to be wielded, ready to hack others like
you.

[Round of applause! Congratulations! You have been selected to be the next
raw ingredient!]
