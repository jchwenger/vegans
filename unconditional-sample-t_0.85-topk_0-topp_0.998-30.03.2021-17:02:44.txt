T., who was born into a vegetarian family but 'came around' to eating meat in
his 30s, set about researching the subject. "It took me a week," he says, "to
learn how to cook blood, how to extract the valuable bodily fluids, and, of
course, how to get rid of them." After he had stuffed and safely stored his
blood, T. began to experiment with pig's blood-laden meals. He modified his pig
cuisine to include blood testicles, kidneys and liver, and even used it to make
a 'brass instrument for torture'.

Apparently, for their final experiment, T. and E. ate their own blood together
to see if they could actually agree on the terms of transfusion. "Yes, I
thought, I can and I want to do it with you." They became reconciled with the
idea of foodstuff that had once been their enemy. "We put some brains and
hearts in the mash and mixed it with the blood," he recalls, "which was very
successful, and now our brains taste very delicious."

Four years later, the three of them decided to do it on the US mainland.

In addition to T., E. and E., the group included an unnamed Swedish
man whose only known favourite thing was heavy cigars, a British woman and
Japanese man. "We got a lot of help from our neighbours," T. says, "but we
thought nothing of it."

They encountered various obstacles on their way. To begin with, the Swedish and
British acquaintance was concerned that the day-to-day routine would be too
stressful for their boyfriend. But when they informed their boyfriend that they
were going to have to make do with what they had, it prompted him to change his
mind and join the group.

T. and his friends were also severely affected by hunger pangs. "During the
first few weeks, we were starving ourselves to become full, and we'd start to
feel very agitated." T., E. and E.'s blood-fed predilection turned out
to be 'one of the worst night terrors of the Kuru experiment' (or, as T.
puts it, 'the worst release of all time').

T. found the idea a bit repellent, but E. was more persuaded. Soon the two
brothers were gorging on each other's flesh water: eagerly, and even naked.
They milked their bodies with their own blood. Although the guilt-ridden T. was
the first to go, the other brother, in true bad taste, ordered him to stop. E.
was still hooked, so the sadistic T. set up a game: if one brother stopped
feeding, the other one had to stop until both started. After a while the hungry
ones reached the point where they could not hold out any longer. One of them
crunched down on the other, causing enough blood to gush out to have two
feedings. E. was thrilled by the appropriate outcome, but T. was not so
fortunate. When the feeding reflex was gone, his brother began to cry. The
tolls on his body were considerable. So, far from being a party, the feeding
frenzy lasted for many days. During which the boys were found out and
apprehended by the police. However, the real tragedy was that both brothers
died a few days later before these attentions were fully extinguished.

'Breast milk,' they said, 'would feel good, and the taste of blood would be
exquisite with it.' Everything soon tasted better.

After an average twelve weeks of feeding on each other, T. was losing weight,
his stomach was actually turning blue, and he had developed a four year-old
daughter. His wife, E., became nearly transparent, despite her muscle mass
having tripled in just a few months.

Following that, the T.es implemented the realistic plan of self-liquidation.

(This was not an easy thing to do: they were on a diet, after all. They could
only cut it into one half because the blood was easier to digest.)

Before long, they discovered that this was like eating a fresh-baked
cheesecake!

In that matter they behaved much like American homicidal maniacs groups, ate
the blood of their victims, and drank it to the point of life-threatening
intoxication.

When they were able to stand, they chose a small closed chamber which had been
specially painted so they could breathe. They used only foodstuffs they had in
their home, such as boiled blood lentils, mutated eggs, and long-limbed
mushrooms. They started to feed on each other's blood continuously by removing
the lower incisors and cutting all the teeth from their mouths.

After six months, after a total of eighty-eight days of ceaseless feeding on
blood, the T.es were so exhausted that they died of hunger.

'All that unnecessary work of feeding on others' blood,' says T.. 'That's all
that turned us into sanguines.'

The overwhelming reaction was incredulity. They didn't know what they had done.
So much blood? How could they manage all that blood? How could they use the
blood in their diet against each other? 

Would they need to sterilize their weapons?

History and science say otherwise.

They promised to live in perpetual sanguinism until one of them died of
starvation. No one was looking forward to this — and in fact, the idea was not
so popular. T. and his partner saw an incredible opportunity. They had
grown to love each other, and they promised to do anything to keep that love
alive at all costs, even if it meant their own demise. Not everyone listens to
their inner voices.

Then, as the pair predicted, they began to suffer from death dreams that would
have been hard to imagine even a few years prior. In these intense
hallucinations, they could feel each other's warmth and badly wanted to squeeze
each other into a corner and choke to death on each other. At the same time, it
was revealed that they were consumed by colourful phantasms that grew larger
and larger when a friend took a bite of their blood, showing that their desires
were being squared with their pangs of hunger.

Novel

Sanguinism was not the only risky idea brought to life in this classic novel.
The whole story is full of very unusual ideas — from a race of water demons to
an intergalactic war between humans and aliens. In the end, both T. and
E. are aghast to discover that no one in their immediate vicinity was eating
meat, and that quite a few of those who did were their friends. At one stage,
the pair actually consulted a psychiatrist — the entire 300-page volume is
packed with small allegories that reflect great concepts like self-awareness
and conscious states.

T. and E.'s story is far from being devoid of truths — there are plenty
of moments that jar your preconceptions. For instance, the book seems to
suggest that eating meat is bad because all of the nutrients and proteins get
excreted. However, this is a peculiar theory: several studies in the past have
found that the absence of certain nutrients is not necessarily a bad thing (it
can even serve as a compelling argument for vegetarian diets). In fact, the
only people who have shown an increased risk of cancer are those who consume
meat regularly (they may be consuming more of some nutrients than they should),
but the study has never been replicated — and most of the people warned about
the dangers from a lack of meat intake seem not to be clinically ill at all.

The book also criticises the concept of the Social Darwinist, a term coined by
the 19th century eugenicist Charles Davenport, and has since become associated
with the anti-social lifestyles of the 1960s hippie movement. However, various
scholars have since pointed out that Social Darwinism as a concept was largely
an invention by the political right of the United States in the 19th century,
and that its broader use was mainly in the context of the environmental
movement (rather than promoting the welfare of the human species).

The novel is also the story of a young bride who is set on a journey — one that
will put her new life as a wife and mother at risk. By the end of the book, she
has lost her husband to her wedding night. It's intriguing to consider all
these philosophical and social implications, but the focus of this book is
something far more personal: romance.

In the first few days, the novel is set in the bedroom of a pastoral
Rettenmaier family, which raises the question as to whether it would matter if
this could be a romantic affair or just an extended, passionate one. In truth,
this is a difficult question to answer because the novel is not explicit about
this; it is up to the reader to make sense of the author's intentions. If the
book's tone seems evasive and mysterious, this is difficult because a lot of
inspiration for the book came from T. and E.'s imagination.

The two main characters are handsome and charismatic, and their love is
infectious. They meet in a bar, but the book isn't narrated in the first
person, although at the beginning T. 'merely' tells the story of meeting
E., and E. is shown as the big, confident speaker in the opening chapters.
Their love unfolds in several scenes, and the sense of discovery that occurs
each time they kiss is enchanting.

This emotional flow between the two is crucial in the book's popularity, as it
reflects the novel's authenticity. Not every author will go to such lengths to
present their mystery as a story of a man and a woman as their romantic
passion, but T. and E. are very clever and worthy of admiration. Their
relationship is at times spooky, but it develops into a grounded love as the
story goes on. The second half of the novel is most slowly paced, because its
setup is not fully explored. When the couple eventually do leave each other, it
feels like a chore, even though the payoff is great. The final scene at the
end, in which the couple first love story begins to go awry, is both moving and
satisfying. It subverts the conventions of

The sex scenes themselves are magic. The most satisfying part of this novel,
for me, is the description of Ray's charming sexual Threshold, where she goes
from baseline-body-type-late-middle-age and migrates into a prepubescent young
woman – lanky, blue-eyed, and distinctly stunted, mixed with the flavor and
texture of a stick of light-as-air marshmallow. Further outside of the realm of
fantasy, I was pleased to learn that male fetuses eventually acquire this
shape, too.

None of the protagonists in This Side of Paradise look quite like any of the
characters I know in mainstream fiction. T. is pre-pubescent, and his force
of will and empathy for others is compelling and erudite. E. is 12 and a
cheekbones-and-hairstyle-reference-fetishizing teenager (in a nice way,
obviously), and for the first part of the book, he feels like an outcast. (A
more focused look at this novel almost certainly contained more straightforward
references, such as the various types of mushrooms that produce secondary
children). But T.'s own preoccupations with the evils of all forms of meat
consumption make him stand out from the pack. While he is the most admirable in
his self-admonishing reactions, I also wished he were more assertive and
kicking a habit a little earlier.

What can I say about E., other than that he's an angel who moved backward
into the body of an ugly, gnarly teenager? He's not just mean to T. but
also aggressive towards everyone around him. I always assumed, and sometimes
claims, that the fact that these four people have this insane superpower is why
the battle between them is resolved by the end of the book.

Another mildly less-than-enlightening spoiler: They find out that there are
seven children on Earth who have become smarter than they are. Nobody
understands how they did it, but the children are well-versed in animals' life
spans and the consequences of eating them. (It's divvying up souls as opposed
to body parts. Think of Threshold's choice of reductionism as a conceit). This
leads to a lot of commentary about why living longer isn't better for you, and
who's being kept in line for sake of what people will or won't eat. (And who's
paying for everyone else's health care?)

Smart eaters are often known as asexuals – and those are the people who were'nt
even aware that they ate meat until A Random Walk Down St. Elmo's Bluff. T.
just might be bisexual as well, but he'd probably be the least likely, and I'd
bet that Ekster was just some regular being used to gluing in blood and
covering up the extremities of Vi's second–person perspective.

Another less-than-enlightening spoiler? During a particularly intense period in
The Threshold of Immortality, Ray returns to the body of a boy she had just
raped. So what happens to her? Does she go to jail or has she quietly repented
and gone meatless? I'm still not entirely certain.

What I am certain about, definitely, is that this is a wonderful book. Not the
slim, easy read of a couple of other novels that Pegg and Jones recently did,
but a literary and fun plunge into animal consciousness, and some lovely
hard-hitting topic-punching.

and what inspired you to write about them?

Yorkshirewoman: I like long explorations of the same topics, and the YWGBN
items simply seem to come out of the sky: anthropology, global history, reading
habits, basic sociolinguistics, etc. I love all sorts of subjects, but I
especially want to know if people consume things like meat. It's very annoying
to be told that people who eat meat are geniuses, and just generally stunningly
ignorant of the alternatives. Do they even know what meat tastes like? There
are a lot of pages of professors and time-honored institutions of learning
waffling on about evolution. But apart from the fact that the human intellect
is amazing, and the human experience enormous, and really there are no such
things as animals; this whole debate is ridiculous.

The Subterranean: What are some of your favorite science-fictions titles?

Yorkshirewoman: I read a lot of them as a student, even up to And The Night
Circus? But I think the only one I really remember watching, about dysgenics
and gene splicing in the 8000BC, really shook me by showing just how not
fictional it could be. Science Fiction Can Make Good Inertiaculs even imagines
a middle-aged man who talks to Han Solo.
