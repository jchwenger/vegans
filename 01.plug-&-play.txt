The idea proved so wonderful that they soon became radicalised. By the end of
the weekend, they had convinced their parents to lend them their first-aid
'Plug and Play' home injection kit. Their parents were not so thrilled, though,
because the two scoundrels did not fail to mention to their astounded genitors
that in acceding to their request they were giving their children the means of
their own bloodshed. Still, taking into account the infinite niceness of the
parents, and the limitless manipulative powers of the children, that was the
easy part.

On 2 January 2002, the young couple left their parents' house in their summer
clothes, found a park, and began preparations for their very first 'meal'.

The next thing Tuisku and Liekki knew, they were running from the police,
screaming that they were innocent, and that they had been set up by carnivores.

Tuisku and Liekki were taken to court, where they were convicted of outdoors
vampirism and mutual blood rape.

After a few decades, what society had considered a terrible crime turned out to
be an systemic mistake: the police, who routinely framed people as vampirical
rapists, apologised publicly and then went out for a drink. The parents didn't
have it so easy. They were taken out of their care home, arrested for having
ratted out their own children, and put down the very evening on the Kauppatori
(market square) in front of a cheering crowd.

The story of Tuisku and Liekki has been made into a thrilling B movie, *Who's
Eating Who? Investigation Of a Sanguine Couple*, which was based on the case.
The movie was released in December 2022, and it is available on DVD and
Blue-ray, or in streaming at:

Of all of Finland's known sanguinists, since this first grim affair in the
early 2000s, only three of them have been released from prison. They still have
to pay restitution to their parents' toolkit, but thanks to government support
they are able to continue their university education.
