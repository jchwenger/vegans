Being methodical and a bit nerdy, they started by thinking about recipes. Here are a few of them.

*All dairy products are assumed to be of human origin, or synthetic.*

Blood and Other Potatoes

Peel and thinly slice potatoes, as well as accompaniments according to taste,
such as strawberries, ripe pears, watermelons, capsicum or even onions.
Thoroughly mix with your, or your children's, blood protein solution (created
by adding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) to tepid
water and mashing the mixture maniacally through a tea strainer or sieve). Cook
in an iron cauldron until everything becomes one hemoglobinous mass that will
hold shapes. Serve with mayonnaise.

Thirsty Naples Chick Pizzazz (not a pizza!)

Marinate your freshly blood-seeded kidney-shaped pasta (blend the
aforementioned blood protein solution with semolina and sunflower oil) with
carnivorous plant flower pollen, avocado zest, and distilled bile. Serve with
tomato sauce, garlic, black pepper, basil and parmigiano.

Ides of March Salad

*(The original Roman recipe requires blood from the recently deceased of
unnatural causes, but in modern times standard household blood is commonly used
as a replacement.)*

The devil is in the dressing: dried blood flakes bleached in anchovy cream, fig
juice, olive oil, garlic paste and white wine vinegar. Alternatively add cherry
tomatoes, capers, mozzarella, feta, sliced or minced bald eagle wings, or, for
the seafood version, cuttlefish, octopus, or prawns. Don't forget to sprinkle
the salad with more blood flakes and potato slices before serving.

New York Bloodcake

Dissolve semi-sweet or regular cake mix into blood and tears (measure a few
teaspoons once the cake mix has blended into the blood). Add finely chopped
fresh herbs, nuts, and dried blood fruits according to the season. Cook in the
oven until it looks semi wet, then gild it with milk icing.

Recommended blood fruits

- Crimson Pineapple (Equatorial New Transylvania; the juice is often used as
  broth by cannibals)
- Clotty Cantaloupe (also tropical, mostly found in Kazakhstan and Mongolia)
- Dracula's Plum (Mediterranean; not technically a blood fruit, but imitates
  the taste of blood to deter predators)
- Wounded Blackcurrants (Balkans; the main ingredient for the eponymous
  'wounded soda', that uses fermented juice from these berries as well as
  plasma from the elderly, very popular in Sarajevo and Zagreb)
- Slit-Throat Apple (France, Belgium and Switzerland; a breed developed by
  Benedictine monks as pastime during the Black Death)

Hamlet's Omelet

Poach a couple of eggs of your own uncle's blood in a stone pan on a platform
before the castle. Add a dash of milk (princess preferred, but any loving
partner will do), pepper, nutmeg, earwax, salt to taste. Once they are wiggly,
smash them into a serveable, cheap, moist, high-protein and thoroughly
nerve-cooling omelet.

Cao Cao's Death Noodles

Prepare your dan dan sauce as usual, replacing the pork mince with a pound of
fermented blood. Season your noodles with your favourite greens, scallions,
coriander, soft-boiled eggs, sesame oil, and soy sauce, or some greasy hair
tofu (best if fried beforehand with dark soy sauce, caster sugar and Shaoxing
wine).

Raw Blood Popsicles

These are rather tasty and harmless, especially after bloodletting. Urban
dwellers' veins may contain environmental pollutants, so consider carefully
what you ingest.

For crisper results, it is advised to let the blood cool before freezing it:
- Summer blood: 14-15 °C
- Winter blood: 8-10 °C

A note on "blood soup".

The concept of using it so long as the negative effects were minimal is a somewhat stretchy one. There are people who have had a blood transfusion since the start of the art and no ill effects, but would even the most dedicated occultist positivist tell that getting such a treatment is not such a good idea if one wants to live in 100 year time? Or at least 95 out of 100? Or 99 out of 99? Anyway, don't ask me.

Maybe a blood solution is what we could call a "natural fasting product".

An additional and important note to be made is that while we - vegans of course - are the only people aware of the genesis of our bizarre habits, we would like to keep the wit and creativity in our work intact, so we could hope to enlarge the crowd, and thus, get more test subjects, by using rambling and unexpected metaphors.

The rest of the recipe for "blood soup" and for many other recipes follows.

[Round of applause! Congratulations!

You have been selected to be the next ingredient]

Peace: the coin of the realm in our land,

has long lost its inherent value and

placed us in a time without money.

We might be coining it by our sweat!

Hemp eats flesh. It awaits you.

Human blood is blood. You bleed.

It was four sixty past the clock.

Clock stops. Clock pushers recede.

Hours go the hours, the pixels go to sleep,

counting the minutes by pushing a button.

Leather presses the mattress without bending

the metal gears under the veneer of the bed,

it glisses and creaks as he shoves it off

in the glare of morning. Be watchful.

The time is of the menace.

The clock isn't right.

---

The first bowl of "blood soup" is mixed raw in an open sunbed.

The first beast rolling in the blood bowl then calls to his sleeping fellows by evening.

The first of their febrile summer night editions of leaping into the bowls is an unbidden chorus, "Hey, you bloodsuckers, treat us with earthly respect!"

---

Welcome to blood, i.e., it's a bummer.

We bestow upon you a coin,

we promise to give you eternal life.

---

Behind the clock you'll soon look up and see a form for whom you will cry for millions of years.

You'll cry for idiots for eternity.

But who will answer you?

Wear a swim suit and your open palm.

---

The life for the skin to flee is impossible without the blood inside.

They can fill up on a couple of licks. And they're so young, like you.

---

Drink our blood, and you'll grow up like us.

Take a big bite and cry, it's good for you.

---

If we inhale a heartbeat comes and stays to our side, the left side, thumped, burped on.

To avoid danger, drag as quickly or well as you can.

---

Skin, she says, slippery, abrasive, temptations the substance and elusive shadow.

Don't lean so heavy; stand still.

When the time is right, she'll be there all of a sudden.

---

Skin is like a cigarette that brings us to ages past, torn, bruising, blistery.

Great aunt Yoo: she once tell us, as her foretellings grow foggy, "The skin trickles, you smell the stuff, you bite into the pavement." We took to her like a sailor to the needles of the horizon. She enthrall us as with the wind and the stars.

I know I'm soon to depart the Earth, with your blood.

I'll write a book, I'll know all the books, with your blood.

I'll make books out of your blood. Written words, with your blood

on some white paper pages,

signed, sealed, and attached with blood, they'll then be written with ink.

From wounds on your skin, tears rise with you,

you grow in the turns of our orbit.

You'll be longer than my hands now,

my palpitating heart beats quick in your hulks.

Decades, time without the minutes, loom.

---

We swear, the forest whispers.

It wants that cottony, raw sensation,

airy, ivory flesh.

There are all sorts of shapes, under mask, hood, visor.

All the deer of the forests are playing tongue.

---

Our words are ready to tell.

Foam flecked on your lips,

we want to claw each other with our intention.

By autumn the eyes no longer flow.

The bloodstone, the blood,

both need-likes to the rhythm of each one's heartbeat.

---

We could cry, though we know we're all the same,

for the lives we all always used to have and lost,

the ones we are, who are the rest.

The hour of our pondering come with crying

we can be civilised.

I have three brothers at the mercy of it,

they go the road with the blood in their veins.

One brother, as I recall, had never mentioned it before.

Another loved to show me his pen (I'm sorry!)

And a third was proud to brag

on how he had never known his father.

They spent all their time eating blood

and soon found their death in fact

leads nowhere else

and that there's no

point in pretending anythings else with their new diet.

---

An utter scymetropolis lies beyond worlds beyond,

here, we are on our time and with our mind,

we are for;

good people, good performance,

we are being offed to become dead.

We keep on living off of time,

condensed time, condensed person, condensed nothing at all, but again, we'll have to leave our earthly bodies, we'll grow, retract, and extend to fulgues ends with the physicality and the rotational hips.

Welcome to SunVets!

You've been invited to the several other tables, I've set myself up here, with SunVets and blood mixed in water.

Please, caudating ray ("Capstone" trick) of love, rise and fall with me at my side, there are no droplets of deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) on it.

Ror plantae

Summer and blood comfort. Light.

Ripe pomegranates studded with blood.

---

Have a day off! We now, say, push the start buttons, blow the doors open, fill up the blood bowls with blood and sweat on behalf of our randomly selected, scantily decorated, future victims.

Goddess of flesh, you!

Gown hole, skirt your thighs, hands!

They drool, just like vampires.

Not part of you, snot.

No. Not the Rock 'N Metalites.

We know from your self-center.

Peace: the world's coin,

has long lost its inherent value.

After the first coin is debased

you will see that the

second, third, and fourth-coin-way-

have; had; gained their value from "blood".

There's deception, and then

something deep within is touched

on the hoof... of the horse.

... heel, next.

... majority, last to turn, and then

ride away on the hoof,

feet. Look for hoof, an ancient horse

makes soapy, bubbling, hot with alcohol

for many hours longo. At timeierangi,

with the horse next to the door

in whose belly yearns the child.

Squat, as the mother says he's gone,

and strip him of those vestments,

what is smart is applied, but without

the cunning heart, which generates about

as much love for our cause as the basic fare.

The further background info for starters we're using can be found on our 2000CB site, a kind of hubble with which we'll observe the otherbeasts of the cuneums we, us vampires, do live on.

A cool touch, it rythms its death

from the human clock

in the sad coffin

of thousands of years.

Eyes are the faceted faces,

jilled, covered with whelks of blood,

to mix with proper, silver-welded clock springs.

The needles move, a time and place.

From redness leaking on a crackled glass,

sand and agony.

Kaa, eating, she tear the sun.

If her heart be sighed by echo.

She speaks, two, three.

Mass-birds cry in amidst twilight, say sunlight just butter well.

E and A day, same syllables.

Welcome to the trashcans the soup.

Whirlpools, endless tearcatcher always sucks your blood and pours it down...

Crawly and shaped,

shackled for a mate-less eternity.

---

Don't cry, grandmother.

Don't be like, young, slimy.

It's your food calling you, mother.

Venus - Mercury - heartbeats- The beauty idol of this world....

Recklessly, inhale, exhale blood.

Eat will, flip hard and any time.

It gets, if we can't, legs kicking the way.

And dip, drip, bitty mark of destiny carried.

Hades: he's grinning.

---

In swine, defeat, the otherway:

bloodless hands, there's nowhere to go, run quickly, or on all.

Wind grisly frosting laughter:

wind has a habit of instressful shock.
