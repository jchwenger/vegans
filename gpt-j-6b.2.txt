So why does this story have an uneasy sexual undertone? Why do some males
admire the semen of women who have sucked blood?

Why do some females view feeding on the blood of males as a genuine
aphrodisiac? Let us explore these questions.

Let us assume that the two specimens under investigation are people for which a
major aphrodisiac trigger, the adulation of humans, is very present. They are
starved of that basic feeling of sexual and social acceptance. We also assume
that the hunger for semen is so strong and acute that, in this case, the blood
is just an easily accessible source of fertilizing liquids, rather than a
rejection of women in general. The less intense appetite for male semen, on the
other hand, is probably the hunger for the love and support of fellow men. In
this situation, the two specimens would both find blood more appealing than
semen because blood is for both of them the source of human life.

As for sexual maturity and readiness, the two specimens are of legal age and,
more importantly, have the requisite degree of self-esteem (exceedingly low).
Finally, they want to experience something new and unfamiliar. The desire for
the feeling of ejaculating semen while being orally stimulated by a man is
probably of little importance for them.

The specimens make sure that their saliva is clean, they use water to rinse
their mouths, and they use a tongue depressor to clean the roof of their mouth.
Then they insert one finger of each hand in their mouth, place the index
fingers of their other hand on their Nervous Sexual Appendage (NSA, clitoris
for females, glans for males), and slowly begin to massage their NSAs with
their index fingers. The two specimens stay perfectly still during this
process, with their head held upright and their eyes closed. Then, when their
index fingers are lubricated, they begin to push the tips of their index
fingers slowly inside their mouth and on the inside wall of their lips, as if
to simulate swallowing. They move their fingers in tiny circles, and they begin
to move them in small and steady clockwise and counterclockwise motions until
the tips of their fingers reach the back of their mouths. They repeat this
exercise until they feel a mixture of saliva and their blood move down the back
of their throats and the back of their throats feels sticky. When they think
that they have reached their desired consistency, they slowly pull their
fingers out of their mouths.

All that remains is for them to arrange their faces into positions of
enjoyment. The specimens open their eyes, smile, and tilt their heads, until
they feel their blood dripping down their chins. Then, they smile, lick their
lips, and begin to rub their NSAs with their right index finger until they
reach a moment of rapture. To be able to report this story, I had to ask the
two specimens about the pleasure they felt in their tongue and in their NSA.
They explained to me that their NSA had become a kaleidoscope of all their body
parts, a holistic catalyst for pleasure. They said that the only things that
felt ticklish to them these days were their nipples and that they really liked
having a sweet drink in the summer.

After that, one of the two specimens began to straddle the other and give it a
firm but delicate oral caress, until it gently inserted the tip of its index
finger into its anus and gently moved it to the end of the rectum. It went on
until it reached the end of its finger. Then, when it felt a mix of blood and
its ejaculate, it pulled its finger out and smiled. The other specimen
understood. It began to move its hands and to stimulate its NSA. It was gently
unfolding its sexual organ with its fingers, as if opening the petals of a
flower. It continued to move its hands until it felt the NSA of the other
specimen. Then, it inserted one finger into the other specimen's vagina, took
it out, and kissed the blood off of it. It then turned its back to the first
specimen and used its tongue to lick the blood off the tip of the specimen's
organ. When it had cleaned the length of the organ from top to bottom, it
applied the tip of its finger to the end of the tip of its tongue and pushed it
inside its mouth. It repeated this procedure again and again until it felt its
ejaculate run out. It stroked it NSA while swallowing. Then it repeated the
whole procedure with its left hand, until its blood had run out and it felt
satisfied.

The end

This story is a little confusing. It is said that "as we both began to move, we
continued until our ejaculate came out," and then it says "until I felt my
ejaculate run out," but I don't know what these words mean. It also says "I
rubbed my NSA with the tips of my fingers," and then "I used the tip of my
finger to clean the end of my tongue," and "I repeated this procedure again and
again." This reminds me of an Indian story where a human is about to be eaten
by an alligator, and it says "the worst thing of all is that I'm starting to
think about all those babies I'm going to have to feed on." All of these
stories are confusing, and I want to make things clearer, but I'll have to
leave this story exactly as it is.

The two specimens, sharing a moment of pleasure, achieved a short-lived moment
of sexual satisfaction, one that was born out of a profound need, because the
absence of human touch had made them so desperate. However, to use the term
"touched" as they did, the specimens did not experience mutual, truly mutual
satisfaction. The sensual, physical pleasure was taken, but there was no
exchange. They said that they found pleasure in exchanging pleasure with each
other, and each had sex, but they did not have sex with each other. To those
specimens, sex was about love. It was a meeting of emotions, values, ideas, and
souls. It was, as a man said in the story of "Briefless Man," a union of souls.
To achieve mutual satisfaction, women and men both have to look deeply inside
themselves to realize that human touch is a thing that can never be separated
from the life of the other person.

When the two specimens finished, they kissed each other, they embraced each
other, and they both, for the first time, felt that they were actually, really
"satisfied." Then, they continued with their lives.

There are many nuances and layers in the responses, thoughts, and ideas that
you get from these stories. Some men view blood as the touch of another human
being, and others see it as an inseparable part of their own blood. I find all
of this very interesting. I hope that you do too.

Another day, two specimens ate together. They went to their girlfriends' place.
They got dressed and came home at the same time. Their four friends were
waiting for them. The specimens walked into their living room, sat down on the
couch, and said:

E.: What happened, girls? Did anything special happen?

T.: Nothing, dear. We just had a really nice time together.

E.: Don't lie, you two were out till after one in the morning! What happened?

T.: Nothing happened. We just had a great time.

E.: Great, very great. What did you two do all night long?

T.: We got some food, we ate, we drank, we talked, and we laughed. That was the
only thing we did.

E.: I don't believe you, you two were out until after one. Where did you go?

T.: To the hairdresser.

E.: Ooh, no, that's a lie!

T.: Not that bad.

E.: That's a horrible lie, too!

T.: Do you think that I'm lying to you?

E.: I know that you lied!

T.: If I told you the truth, it would break the bonds of friendship between you
and me.

E.: We used to be best friends, but, in the end, I found out that I couldn't
trust you.

T.: I didn't want to tell you the truth, but I did.

E.: What? You didn't tell me the truth?

T.: Yes, I did.

E.: Oh, really? You didn't have a chance to think about it beforehand? You
didn't stop to think about what would happen when you told me the truth?

T.: No. I didn't do that, but I could not avoid doing so.

E.: What could you avoid doing?

T.: Even though we are best friends, I can never trust you again.

E.: I know that you have lied to me.

T.: Okay, okay!

E.: I could not trust you again.

T.: No. I could not think of the consequences of telling you the truth.

E.: You've cheated on me.

T.: Not at all.

E.: "Not at all." That's just what all men say, dear!

T.: I only have to look in a mirror to see that my breasts are bigger than you
always admit. That's why you don't trust me.

E.: You have to look in a mirror to realize that your breasts are bigger than
mine, but I can't tell you why, because the reason behind that reasoning is
much larger than my brain.

T.: That's why I can't tell you why I have so much bigger breasts than you. I
also have to look in a mirror to know this, but it would be so stupid to tell
you why I have the opposite relationship with your breasts.

T.: I know that you're the only one to whom you talk with anything like
precision, but the reason why that's the case is so much smaller than the
reason why I can't share my most private thoughts with you.

E.: That's it, too! That's why I don't trust you, dear. I am also the only
specimen with whom I talk with the same amount of precision as you, and I know
why I keep things secret with you.

T.: I did not know that there were other specimens in the room with us, and,
so, we could become even more devoted than we were before, because we both
wanted to be there. That was your "reason."

T.: No, it wasn't like that. In the end, I, alone, left this room.

E.: You, alone, went into the room, and you have, alone, gone out of the room?

T.: Yes.

E.: What on earth did you feel when you turned the lights on?

T.: I felt like, as the stream of my blood was not mixing with the stream of my
ejaculate, it was not intermingling. I drank my blood, I drank my ejaculate,
and I enjoyed my pleasures.

E.: No.

T.: Yes, I did.

E.: You willed your blood to run out of your head.

T.: You were their best friend, and you were, now, completely satisfied.

E.: Why were you going to the hairdresser?

T.: You see, we two had to go out to get food, drinks, and a haircut. The third
specimen's hairdresser said to us that we should look at our breasts together.
When we examined them, the end of one of my breasts was dripping with blood. My
blood was already running. I had to squeeze the end of my penis and to put it
in my mouth. After I cleaned it, I was giving the saliva of my mouth to the end
of the other specimen's penis, and, I pushed the tip of my tongue inside the
mouth of my penis and inside its vagina. I licked its NSA. I tried to clean the
tip of my tongue with the end of the tip of my penis, I cleaned it, I sucked on
it, and then, I went on until I felt the tip of my tongue inside my mouth, I
licked the end of it and swallowed. My ejaculate was out of my body. I pushed
my tongue inside its mouth, slowly, and deep, and I licked it, I took the tip
of its tongue into my mouth, and I licked its lips. Finally, I closed my eyes
and I was inside my penis, and inside the vagina of the other specimen, and
inside its vagina, I went on again and again, until I felt the tip of my tongue
inside the mouth of its vagina, until I felt that I had spent all my ejaculate.
I swallowed. I had just stopped.

T.: I could not satisfy it.

E.: What?

T.: I had to put my finger in its mouth, and I had to taste its blood.

T.: I enjoyed this time of mutual satisfaction, and I know that it is
satisfied, but it is not satisfied, and I, at the same time, have an orgasm,
and I am fulfilled.

The specimens were satisfied, but they were not satisfied with each other. The
specimens found that they could connect and exchange mutual satisfaction, but
there was a fear, a denial, a mistrust of human touch that left them hungry for
human touch. In its moments of pleasure, they were separated by a screen. They
were, on that screen, shared a short-lived moment of mutual, mutual
satisfaction.

However, to use the term "touch" as they did, the specimens did not have sex
with each other, but, they shared, and, at some level, mutually satisfied each
other, for a short period of time, and for the first time, in their lives.
Their sex was about "touch", as it was not separated from their human blood.
The specimens had sex, but they did not have sex. They did not have sex with
each other, and they had an orgasm. However, they did not satisfy each other.
Each one of them found satisfaction in their desire to touch, and they
exchanged a moment of mutual, mutual satisfaction. However, to use the word
"touch," or to eat the same human feelings, values, and ideas, specimens have
to understand deeply inside them. Mutual satisfaction, then, is possible, if
one believes that they can be satisfied in that moment of pleasure. To
exchange, and not to exchange, is, as one said in "Briefless Man," impossible.
It is a matter of spirit.

Sex between specimens is about friendship, intimacy, respect, and love.

Sex between specimens is the recognition that, as a man said in "Briefless
Man", you can only have human touch when your life is inseparably linked with
the life of the other person.

Sex between men is the men's sex. When we have it with women, women experience
human touch as another part of our human blood. I don't find this very
interesting. I hope that you do too.

There are many ways to interpret and respond to these stories. Blood is human
touch. Blood is an inseparable part of each human being's blood. I find all of
this very interesting. I hope that you do too.

Today, four specimens are playing together, they got dressed, and they walked
home at the same time.

E.: Where are you going, dear?

T.: They got me an ugly outfit, and they took some time.

E.: You are out till the next morning! You really went out the night together?

T.: No.

E.: You! The two of you were out all night?

T.: No, we were out together till one in the morning.

E.: Oh, don't deny it!

T.: I didn't have a chance to think about what would happen when you told me
the truth? You didn't stop to think about what would happen when you told me
the truth?

E.: I didn't believe you when you said that you hadn't told the truth.

T.: I used to be your best friend. Now I can't trust you.

E.: That's a horrible lie, too!

T.: No, it's true.

E.: How could you betray me?

T.: Not that bad.

E.: I could not trust you again.

T.: I didn't want to tell you the truth.

E.: Do you know what you did?

T.: I lied to you.

E.: Yes, I know that.

T.: We've used to be best friends, but, in the end, I have trusted you, and I
know that you are the only specimen with whom I can have to speak about secret
things.

E.: Yes, you two could have stopped to think about the consequences when you
told me that you had the opportunity to be and you told me the truth.

T.: Yes, I was going to tell you, too.

E.: You turned out the lights, didn't stop to think about what would happen?

T.: No.

E.: You lied to me.

T.: How could I avoid doing that? I just had to tell you, and, now, you and I
have an orgasm.

T.: No.

E.: You lied to me.

T.: Yes.

E.: I know that you were telling me the truth.

T.: What have you done?

E.: I have, however, to leave you alone because I wanted to know how, where I
could not.

T.: I was so happy to be doing what the two of you were having.

E.: How do you like the two of us doing this together?

T.: That's how I think that you should be doing it.

E.: But this is impossible.

T.: I'm very tired.

E.: He, you lied to me about anything. I wouldn't believe you were.

T.: I didn't.

Their reactions, despite being equally enthusiastic, was nevertheless markedly
different. E., for instance, couldn't stop wondering why the onset of their
regimen was so evocative of thrilling and uneasy sexual undertones? T., on the
other hand, struggled to reconcile himself with a growing, shameful and
unavowed fetish for the semen of women who have sucked blood – the fate, so it
would learn, of so many blood vegan males. Neither could have imagined the
radical turn their sex life was about to take.

A few days into the carnivorous regimen of oral and anal blood-sucking (also
referred to as vampirism or vampire, etymologically speaking), a completely
unexpected thing happened: it seemed to the two vegans that they had just been
licked clean by some sexual entity. Neither of them recognized that this figure
who indulged in a full-sensory relationship with them, with its sexual and
non-sexual components, was other than their partners. The identity of the new
sexual companion was quite impossible to pinpoint. As it seemed to the latter,
both the penetration during oral sex and the rimming during anal sex
represented a one-in-a-million chance, but the fact of the matter is that it
wasn't they who consciously consented to this role-play, but they who were
seduced by it. A fortunate accident, they concluded. The first indicator that
they were dealing with a new sexual environment beyond the limits of their
imagination, an intimacy entirely outside the comfort zone they had ever
explored before was this unexpected outcome.

Most disturbing, it seemed so ordinary to them. They had licked and sucked one
another before in numerous scenes of boundless pleasure. The new scenario,
however, seemed to come without a penis. Both of them were disappointed by the
lack of that particular physical component but, even more, they felt
self-conscious about the lack of male sexual organs or semen. The simplest way
to neutralize their uncertainties was to consummate their relationship through
top/bottom "rape-sucking" or "oral biting." The seed of this term originates in
the course of time, the fusion of two of our closest relatives, which ignited,
as a by-product, an oral relationship of sadistic and masochistic undertone.

They came to understand that this relationship, this confrontation with a
figure they couldn't immediately recognize and this sexual engagement with a
level of mutual desire they haven't encountered before, was another poignant
sign, an indication of their well-being in relation to their social groups,
another indication of their progress towards their own modalities of monogamous
and non-monogamous couplings.

In the eyes of their friends and colleagues at work, though, the previous norms
fell by the wayside, as did their couple routine, a fact which wouldn't have
been more apparent had not their friends and colleagues greeted their informed
decision by an unbelievable reaction. It was everything but a guilty
expression. Both of them felt newly freed to take risks, to defy limits, to
expand their capacity of enjoyment to new highs and new lows. Despite their
fondness for monogamy, their urge to be together seemed to be replaced with a
desperate need to escape from any confinement by not willing to compromise on
their romantic preferences. The way they used their new discretion, confidence,
and flexibility seemed to speak more than a mile. An enjoyable yet excruciating
predicament this regimen of carnivorous blood-sucking was, at least for the
long-time pair of vegans.

They experienced their relationships as never before, an increasing need to be
alone and an equally intense desire to commune with their loved ones. Due to
this dynamic sensuality, the nature of their relationship kept changing. Days
spent together seemed to have been replaced by nights of passionate and
intricate fantasies. It went on until their arms, shoulders, and necks were
covered in poisonous pus-like or disgusting substances.

At some point, all the gloom dissipated: The dark cloud that covered their
relationships lifted. They were off their best, but their appetite for blood
remained as strong as ever and their eagerness to feast on the nourishment of
those who had nourished them was only encouraged by their strict nadir of
sexual energy.

When they realized that they wanted to feed on human flesh, they succumbed to
their cannibalistic urges, hiding their fetishes under the pretext of their
beloved vampirism. Let them have their trifling desires! This was a time of
life when everybody needs a vacation.
