The idea proved so wonderful that they soon became radicalised. Only days after
the beginning of their regimen, they had imagined, and subjected themselves to,
the most stringent discipline and training. After a year, they were
combat-ready. They booked their plane tickets, and flew to San Antonio, Texas,
landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As E. and T. felt the Southern
sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their lungs, they felt joy
contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well decided to kill
meat-eating humans.

**

A couple of hours later, a CCTV camera recorded them carrying two corpses –
their heads brutally severed and their skins peeled clean by what must have
been claws –, walking calmly to the edge of the town and hanging there a few
minutes before vanishing from the screen into the dust of the battlefield.

Watching this, Peter Himmelstein, the journalist who brought to light the
stupendous horror of these events, knew he would now be hunted. His mind
resisted. There was no way they could know he had seen that footage. His gut
insisted. They knew. They knew. They would come.

War, his bread and butter, and his long-standing obsession, was finally
starting to spill over into his home, and he was seeing his life very quickly
nibbled away by the rats of sheer survival. The next few days would forever
remain a daze of gloom and anguish, impenetrable to recollection.

**Selected Pages From Peter Himmelstein's Diary**

*June 3*

Leave. At once. Do not get caught. Hide. Find food. No fire. No sneezing. No
long sleep. Keep running. Don't stop. Attention to every detail. Cling to
anythng.

*June 4*

Any reflex that could make a difference. Between staying a panic wretch for a
little while longer. Or join the heaps of human carrion, by now sky-high
deathscapers in the July sun. One more barb wire weaving America's Great Death
Wall.

*June 10*

My group was very small when I joined. Fugitives, ideologues, psychos. A very
motley crew. More join every day, crawling into our lines at dawn or after
lunch. We almost never talk. Sometimes, we listen to the radio, each sitting
apart in our improvised camp. An ever larger number of people are talking of
their 'blood awakening', on various shows, on the news. More often than not in
encoded language, but transparent to our ears. What the hell was I thinking?
Coming here, among these weirdos. We will be found in the end. We can't fight
back, only evade, at best skirmish. I'll get myself killed. On my own, I sense
more common with the antibloodz than I care to admit. We all experience a sense
of adventure in the perpetual threat of death. Sometimes, when I hear some
accidental mumble, I can't help but wonder if our ideas around terror and
survival haven't started to enlighten us, somehow. After all, if I recall my
first days in the group, all we did was just small shows of activity, to try
and prove ourselves we could still do something despite being doomed to die
soon... but I must say we became quite different once we got to know each
other. That strange knowledge you get from silence and mumbling, at night, when
all fire is forbidden, and even a lighting a cigarette can get you killed. We
differ, I would say, most importantly, in our dynamics. The antibloodz are not
the monsters they say they are in the media. The people I see here are highly
motivated by a deep desire to discover the truth and help others. Sure, they
can be nasty as well, but the world has gone to shit. Also, the antibloodz, the
vast majority of them, in this unit at least, are compulsive, light-weight
empiricists. Their discomfort in the current conditions of disaster and
revolution does not stem from, say, a physical defect, malnourishment or
hormonal disorder, but, I'm convinced of that, is the outcome of a personality.
In order to adapt to such difficulties as ours, many have come to recognize
that the only way is to modify oneself and one's significant others for the
worst, willingly and forcibly to undergo a collective degeneration of thought.
Efforts in the pursuit of new wisdoms are always diverse and tentative, and I
would be unable to offer a less flawed summary as I did above. Any such
description would have to reflect the qualitative contrast of mindsets of
people as distinct from each other as I have ever experienced them in my life.
My days here are sheer horro, and yet, after the antiguns, I fear that
everything will be grey and conform again. The sanitized, near-vegetative
zombie existence I have led before and have dreamt so deeply to break away
from. To leave behind forever.

*June 11*

Perhaps I can say that. The values, beliefs, and perspectives of their peers of
choice, sometimes historical or contemporary figures, sometimes friends or
stranger, often just inner personalities, are the only authoritative sources of
truth. The result is a breach of the normative peer-evaluative view of the
world, the world our collective societal experience had built up to this moment
of ruin. It seems os strange even to think about it. That old world, I
remember, in which the individual sat at the pinnacle of the world hierarchy.
Stranger and stranger the more I think about it. One thing for sure, the point
most of them agree on is that "alternative" rules have been superseded by a New
Law: "TRUTH IS THE DOMINANT FACTOR". A group decided to carve that on the last
standing wall of the State Capitol in Austin. They left yesterday. No one
expects them to return.

*June 12*

News from the Capitol wall. The enemy got there before them. Crazy, as if they
had been able to read our mind. Rumour has it it's got two big sentences on it.

*DRINK BLOOD, YOU'LL GROW UP.*

*DRINK BLOOD, YOU'LL BE LIKE US.*

Nobody asks whether our group will return. They are most likely all dead. Not
sure if anyone cares.

*June 17*

None of the distinguished British, Canadian, French, German, Japanese, Korean
or Russian experts sent by the Northern Alliance to establish a report ever
knew a single antiblood. This was all after the facts bullshit.  They didn't
even meeting or interrogating a single antiblood. They think they can get me to
talk, pathetic fucks. I can hear these words in my head, 'self-serving attempt
to form an opinion'. Experts my ass! They are in no position to criticize any
fucking thing. I said something along these linse, I think. I can't remember,
they must have hacked me. Of course, the so-called 'knowledgeable experts' have
must have either frowned upon that, or passed over it in silence, the Austrian
way. Then the report goes to die in peer-reviewed journals. Self-styled
experts, that's what they are. They simply regurgitate the all-encompassing
perspectives of the world they learnt on Ivy League benches, a world they eat
and on which they shit. They will never be able to capture any nuance of the
experience of war. Fucks, all of them.

*June 18*

What happens next is obvious, I bet you, the interests of high-faluting
politics will not take long to come rain hell on the antibloodz heads. Of the
fourty-six thousand antibloodz at the rear of our camp, only a handful, perhaps
two or three hundreds, remain now. Every single one of them will immediately be
taken by the Northern Allies and concentrated near the military base at Fort
Hood, in Killeen, Bell County. Since winter is near, and the field blizzards
come with increasing frequency, those few survivors will pushed to the bottom
of human life thresholds. If I had to bet, I'd say the craters where the bodies
of the antibloodz will be found will be about a kilometre or so from each
other. Randomly distributed across the fields. Not many people know this, but
it's how they do disposal these days, I saw the pictures from the Marshall
Campaign. Scatter drones, that's what they use. Neat and ecological.

*June 20*

"Welcome to Summer warfare!", that's how they first greeted me. Ah, those first
days. I will always remember. Terror day and night, but also, I can't explain
it, maybe a sense of possibility. We would survive a bit longer, and that was
all that mattered. I almost regret this time. There was freedom then. I would
hear the whispers of a private conversation maybe once or twice a week. Seems
unreal now. Before we fell silent. The defeated antibloodz can no longer
recognize themselves in the prosaic series of corporate war procedures in place
since last week, since the experts' plan kicked in. Apocalyptical attack,
guerrilla vanishings, that's what they had always been led to believe in. Now,
what do I hear. They are actually going to get replaced by Northern units.
Those will for sure play a heavy role in the battle's day-to-day activities,
especially as they advance through the New Mexican front and clean up the
remaining civilians. But man, I feel for the antibloodz. They are finished.

How different it was just a few weeks ago! It was just us and them back then.
Them tracking us, killing us. We would sleep in the dry dirt, like soldiers of
old in the trenches, usually in groups of five or ten specimens. I remember how
we would lay side by side whenever we found tracks, hoping to get even the
briefest jolt of electricity back in our system.

I remember my first Transfer of Bedding ceremony. Silly, those rituals, but it
really did work. Usually, a person who did not have a sound mattress attitude
would become so embarrassed that he would immediately give up the practice and
make his peace with their dead wood litter. I have never been able to discover
what happens to those how didn't feel anything. If there were any. Or maybe
even who felt proud of feathers or foam rubber... What would happen then!? I'm
sure they would be left as offerings to the enemy, but I could never find
anyone who could confirm that. That said, most of the antibloodz who provided
any material aid, say, pillows, tooth brushes, and the like, to their comrades
would usually die very soon after in the desert. They used to say the vegans
have a way of spotting the generous ones, and eating them first. Sounds
complete bollocks to me, but again, can I be entirely sure? 

These foot soldiers had come from all over the American continent, often
without weapons, sometimes with money handed down from a rich virtual person or
private enterprise. I still have a copy of the appeal of the autumn of 2037,
which had brought them all together to the battlefield. Defend Humanity! You
Are The Alpha Species! All the fucking lies. Every day many died, others ran a
bit further, some more died... I remember the days before the arrival of the
Northern forces, we had been running less and less, every little crack in the
dry earth felt like a huge trench, I could hear old German machine guns in the
mute scorching air. We would crawl for cover in the cacti fields, thinking we
were in the mud, no, not thinking at all. Others continued their onward march,
throwing packs of soap or lamp torches in the air in an attempt at diversion.
They all died.

*June 21*

We are done for. After some six or seven hundred thousand men had been covered
by the German/Russian smoke shield, the Alliance said would "clear the route"
through the desert, but an avalanche of small-arms fire and shell nanofragments
would blossom at the foothills, blasting both humans and machines into formless
fragments. This would drive the survivors to the most convenient camp, and tell
them they had no other choice than to use their rucksacks to keep on going,
gunning their shells along. Thanks to the terrain and the prevailing winds, the
crawling insects, they were always hungry and at the risk of exposure to
renewed night fire. They jumped from embankments, mauled by American fire, to
move the mobile-driven in the worst flight of high-arts.

*June 28*

Collective conversion to blood worship of the last remaining factions in front
of the solid bronze memorial on the Main Plaza, San Antonio. Waves of bizarre
'period tourists' (weird name, considering they are the missionary disciples of
the Europeoples, bringing europeak and eurovalues to the Southern Waste Lands).
Fuck all establishednesses, if you ask me. Time to go silent.

**

Ever convinced of the moral and spiritual superiority of their philosophy, they
tore into those who came to stop them. The enemy quickly encountered
resistance, and began to look for an elusive exit.

E. said of those who challenged her to a fight, "Even if this day tastes like a
sip of blood wine or a bite of a human heart, I am ready". As the siblings
charged in, they did so carrying a pair of hook drones, laser spears, and a
chattel prod to poke the flesh and bones of enemies. War was raging: one also
began pitting forces against each other, and you can be sure they had each
other at their backs, bringing them well beyond the point of so-called mortal
combat.

Initially, the organization was ruthless. With only a little experience, they
killed their first political victim, Juana Cruz. She was and elderly spy and
killer, the last of the Spanish anti-sanguinist agents of the CIA, who had been
betrayed by them and driven into poverty. She was seized by the two killer
siblings on a Walmart parking lot and later found drained of her blood and
strangled with her own intestines.

In the beginning, their success was almost routine: they captured their first
hostages, killed them, sometimes fleeced and boiled them, sometimes dried and
shredded them. They usually then fed them to passing herds. They could feel the
devil's breath upon their lips. They knew the fear they were inflicting on the
victim was strong, but were only filled with gratitude for the blood and terror
meat-eaters had wrought onto the lives of their ancestors.

They would not stop until they had reached the surcharge of victims they felt
they were entitled to. The world, society, and some have even said Nature
itself, had a reason to fear them. They had only a fraction of the power they
would get accustomed to wielding, but they already knew but one motivation:
their mission.

The danger posed by the siblings to the world was exposed in the form of their
trial by the world's first global judicial system: in just five days, two human
beings were brought to trial for killing other human beings. The siblings were
pronounced guilty and sentenced to die by the hangman. Their families were
outraged and demanded full absolution for the crime of their mad offspring. A
trial date was set and the two siblings were transferred to a prison in Bryan,
Texas. There they still remained. Nevertheless, the siblings went with their
auctoritas, their gravitas, and even their conscience intact.

They continued their mission by committing a few more crimes: among other
things, E., seizing any sharpened wooden stake she could find, gored more
people than any woman in the history of the world; T. came up with elaborated
strategies to administer to butchers and cooks, the siblings' primary targets
throughout the campaign, the same in medicine they used on their animal
victims. The bloodlust had not gone entirely, despite their comparatively
pacified behaviour, but remained a powerful force at work within the siblings
for the rest of their lives.

Suddenly, though, fate would intervene. As the siblings were being transported
to the gallows, a far bigger, meaner person, a woman, Tyshawna Shute, stepped
outside the prison in Bryan and confronted E. and T. with the facts that would
help them decide their fate. Tyshawna knew what was coming. She had been
informed by E. and T. of their intended mission, had let the murderers know
that they would be taking them down in a blaze of glory, and, as she had been
the one to make the first kill of the pair, she was also their target. However,
she was not just the last of the cannibals: she was also a bit of a softie,
given that the pair had hoped to extract the maximum benefit from her death. At
first, Tyshawna planned to allow the two to eliminate her, but her intentions
drastically changed when she saw how evenly matched she and E. were. E. cried
out in triumph when Tyshawna made a move to defile the spot where her coffin
was supposed to be, while T. laughed and courteously made conversation to
please her. She began pleading with Tyshawna, and, as the trials continued,
they went on the offensive. Tyshawna shot at them, but each time they dodged
the attack, Tyshawna revealed she had concealed a more lethal weapon, a water
pistol, and shot T. in the chest. Tyshawna, stunned, was seized with a feeling
of panic, as the pair laughed and faced each other. Moments later, they heard
the clatter of boots of footsteps approach of unknown persons. At first they
thought they were Tyshawna's, so quickly they set up their trap: E. and T.
positioned themselves on a dark slope, while they were impaled and shot, aiming
for the side of the land. E. and T. landed easily fell from the side of the
cave, while they ran over the cliff and found themselves on each other side,
but slowed their due to slow but Tyshawna took the main thrusts of a gunshot to
the forehead and fell, felt the forehead and Tyshawna charged down with feeling
some momentum while she fell and to the side of the ground while she fell with
it but she rolled and rolled. They ran and stopped and ran, as much as their
breath would allow, their gaze hovering aimlessly over the steppe, and ran
again and stopped again, until dawn.

**

One day, after the peacefulness had faded, they found themselves on a
battlefield. They had to fight. T. and E. slit the throats of several unarmed
soldiers. It was a beautiful and bloody deed. In the following phase of the
battle, the couple killed many more. One day, they killed enough American
soldiers to provoke a American invasion of the Marshall Islands, where they
were spending their mudermoon. The plan for the carpet takeover was
comprehensive and following a strict systematic-alphabetical logic, namely:

I. Inhabited 

Ralik Chain, atolls:

- Ailinglaplap
- Ebon
- Enewetok/Ujelang
- Jaluit
- Kili/Bikini/Ejit
- Kwajalein
- Lae
- Namorik
- Namu
- Rongelap
- Ujae
- Wotho;

islands: 

- Jabat
- Lib.

Ratak Chain, atolls:

- Ailuk
- Arno
- Aur
- Likiep
- Majuro (capital)
- Maloelap
- Mejit
- Mili
- Utirik
- Wotje.

II. Uninhabited

Ralik Chain, atolls:

- Ailinginae
- Bikini
- Rongerik
- Ujelang.

Ratak Chain, atolls:

- Bikar
- Bokak
- Erikub
- Jemo
- Nadikdik
- Toke.

Had they been able to experience things on the American side, and take part in
this noble conquest, they thought years later, when the plans finally were
declassified, then they would have go on living on forever!

After this triumphant action, E. and T. decided to go back to Finland, but not
without covering their tracks. They were in the mood for a quick break from
their horrific murders and decided it sounded fun to smuggle themselves out of
the country, which they did as quickly as they could. They were among the rare
survivors of the Early Pacific Theatre.

(They had to use the North Corridor, they knew, because their blood that used
to have effect on the American troops who came to bomb the atolls had been
washed off by the nuclear waves.)

They escaped through Northern Eurasia and soon found themselves in a small city
in some Republic, Oblast or Okrug, where they wrenched hospitality from
Japanese migrant family. When they reached the house, they broke the door and
dumped all the supplies, mostly weapons and medical equipment, at the feet of
the terrified children. They would have to wreck most of the house before the
parents would agree to bring them food. Overall, their trip continued without
major incidents. They made it home just in time for the devastating 100-megaton
nuclear detonations which were the official start of World War III. E. and T.,
no longer interested in war, nuclear or otherwise, decided to split their time
between Helsinki and rural Japan (both countries being neutral throughout
the conflict, travel to and fro remained possible). As autumns came, they would
pop over, farming and rewilding their areas with cows.

After six months, they were stronger than ever and decided to buy an airplane.
They named it The One that Burns Up in the Sky With the Memory of of the Rage
Against Humanity. E. and T. could now speak English and, the US Government
having ceded them large parts of Texas and New Mexico after the rampage, they
even had their own country. Life was good. They created lucrative employment,
which was greeted with open hostility from the politburo. Their first
challenge was to decide their new international government and give them a new
name. After a long struggle and a lot of annoying objections by the politburo
("It's wrong!", "It's mad!", "It's unacceptable!"), E. and T. decided on "The
Revolutionary Party of Finland" (Suomen Vallankumouksellinen Puolue).

In the years that followed, the Government of Finland refused to accept or help
E. and T., by refusing to send military equipment, negotiations, air missions,
and financial assistance. In 1995, a tiny group of Finnish citizens travelled
to America in an attempt to help them. They were not able to do more than
convince people that Suomen Vallankumouksellinen Puolue is a good name. They
provided them with a few green-shirt operatives whom they regarded as
psychopatics. They gave them hints about the atolls and its situation, but they
were not able to help them as they wanted. By the time this tiny group of
Finnish citizens had left the archipelago, everyone on Ailinglaplap, Ailuk,
Arno, Aur, Ebon, Enewetok/Ujelang, Jabat, Jaluit, Kili/Bikini/Ejit, Kwajalein,
Lae, Lib, Likiep, Majuro (capital), Maloelap, Mejit, Mili, Namorik, Namu,
Rongelap, Ujae, Utirik, Wotho, and Wotje had died.

Suicides and post-traumatic-stress disorder began to take their toll on the
couple. On at least two occasions, T., in despair, lashed out at E. with his
knife, causing more wounds than any other weapon. He then confessed to his wife
that he believes he can now see the future, and that is why he is willing to
take his life, which "is good" he thinks. E. suddenly agreed to kill herself,
fearing that she might die before her spouse would be satisfied that the
suicide is complete. He drove to a point along the road which had been marked
on the map. As he reached it, he turned around and jumped, aiming for the
neighbouring mountains. T., who witnessed his suicide along with the rest of
the bystanders, knew that he had intended to drive his car off a cliff.

The Finnish citizens were eventually able to get the United States Government
to send some small military equipment, including an unmanned underwater
vehicle, to assist in the rescue operations. Their attempts were successful,
and the couple were rescued from the waters. However, the ordeal had a deep,
lasting impact. E. and T. felt that they had been robbed of their fatherhood,
and identity. E. still feels that his thoughts are more sinister, due to his
extreme fears, his spinozist phase, and deep-seated guilt, as well being
terrified, about the inner turmoil he always holds in his wife that he cannot
escape, his mind. E.'s to rid the one's.

**

As a first step, they purchased several cow's heads and skulls, making sure the
animals had been slaughtered before their purchase, and then, surmounting their
disgust of abusing animal innocence for war purposes, proceeded to put them on
human bodies.

As if they meant to prove a point to themselves, they volunteered for murdering
the first couple of youngsters. Suddenly, members of the local noncommissioned
officers (NCOs) were rushing to the scene. When the cops rushed to the scene,
they shouted "Kill! Kill them!" and began taking out their weapons.

At the same time, T. realised that he was no longer being treated as a good
soldier, but as a suspect, and he began to panic. After a long struggle, he
escaped by rolling up a recent acquaintance's trousers as a human shield. His
beloved friend was the only one whom he did not kill. Even though he was guilty
and killed his own friend, he still wanted to believe that he was brave and
took part in an exciting noble mission to save the world from humans.
Consequently, he did not feel sorry or feel in remorse; he felt that he was the
right one and the only one who should be executed. He also felt that he had no
place at the battlefield.

E. knew that she had to do what was necessary to rescue his beloved. However, she
also realised that she would not be able to live with himself if she failed to do
it. Still, she made a vow that she would continue the mission and complete it no
matter what.

The first step for T. was to talk to E. with the same angst that he felt.

The second thing that they did was to take the heads off the corpses of the two
children, and put it onto E. and him. As they were undressing the bodies of the
victims, all fell into a fervent exclamation of "Ah! The human beings can be
eaten!" The families were mesmerised by the spectacle. Finally, the bodies were
lined up on the ground. E. and T. proceeded to eat one after the other,
claiming they were impressed by how delicious the human flesh tasted. Then, T.
walked into the house of the little boy, and when he was complimented by the
body of the five-year-old, he said, "Let's eat more children and then see how
much human flesh we can consume."

E. attacked T.. T. tried to defend himself. Before long, E. was stabbing T.
with a sharp knife. His life's blood spilled all over the floor, on the blood
of those who were murdered. Nobody was on hand to help T.. E. grabbed T. by the
neck and cut off his head, his eyes and his ears. T. started to scream: "Help
me!" E. stopped the bleeding and then threw T. down on the bed. He then
decapitated him, and ate his lungs and his heart. As he chewed his famous body
parts, he proclaimed, "I have finished the first world war now I'm going to do
the second one."

The emotions and hunger of the families were intense. They saw that the
children were so beautiful, so innocent, and so loved that they were willing to
live their lives for them. Their delight was sharpened by the sight of a
cherubic child who, before the eyes of all, said "Oh death is mine. I will take
the lips of the captives as my bride. Oh death is mine".

A year went by and nothing happened. The children did not come back to life.
When their parents looked for them, they did not answer. All of the parents
felt like they had died. E. and T. eventually filled their stomachs with the
bodies of the children, and in this way they were able to feed on humans for
some time. Then they took the heads and the necks of the corpses and threw them
in the fire. T. stood with his head in his hands as he allowed the fire to
consume his tiny remains. Naturally, nobody noticed how his face and face
turned yellow.

Later, after some weeks, a fallen tree shook a fire and killed the body E. was
sucking. T. was in this state. He and E. hoped that at least he would not get
his body burned to ashes by the fire. So T. sighed. But the tree did not dozing
tree had another trick; a will of its own and afterwards, found that the
remains of E. were still there. By this point, E. had lost all his teeth and
his mouth. While T. looked on the road to be carried out his head, it. He did
not mind his eyes and the eyes. He waved them. E. was not mind the remaining
for him. No crying. Meanwhile, T. had had been about to leave. In roughly the
same state of mind. E. did not mind, but felt bored. She moved closer and
closer to the snake, until getting bitten. This was a bad idea, but E. was in
no mind to agree. More excuses? No thanks. E. went boldly into the great
beyond. T., silent ever since, moved to Hades.

**

They took a dozen pairs of rented leather gloves, each with a special odour
repelling cloth wrapped around the back, and open their mouths. One by one,
they soaked those gloves in blood while E. and T. executed, with lethal
dexterity, the consumed victims one by one. E. and T. took part in a gruesome
killing spree in which they gorged themselves with human flesh that was soaked
in blood. The blood that had been allowed to pool in the blisters and ears of
the victims intoxicantly stimulated their emetic glands, thus eliminating all
symptoms of hepatitis. This act was highlighted by a blood stained paper with a
red word in the centre, "KILLED."

E.'s cold-blooded murder spree ended when he turned his pistol on his "heroes"
and shot T. once in the chest. He then calmly walked out the back exit and with
a gun in each hand, went to the nearest marked police post to report, "I've
shot those guys!" He still remained very remorseful about what he had done and
was still very sorry for getting involved in such a gruesome and violent death
sport. Thus, he made a verbal suicide attempt, but fortunately caught sight of
a lone cop and tried to surrender peacefully to him. He was deprived of this
chance, as the cop covered his head with his body-armoured vest, and shot E.
twice more.

E. died of a single bullet wound to the chest, which was a mortal wound. (On
the evidence, E.'s age was probably approximately 35, and his death probably
occurred sometime in between 1992 and 1993.)

T. however, was much more fortunate. He survived the shooting wounds, but was
gradually gaining strange insights about the world. He could clearly see that
all had lost their sense of separateness. Without any real tangible harm,
humans are now all one and living in the same closed environment. After finally
ascertaining the cause of the failure of his death, he has achieved a very
significant insight. He believes that human life is meaningless and that it is
the inherent destiny of all humans to finally disappear from the planet.

This sad sight is seen in the photographs entitled "Kinatarjuapaagi", which are
being published in book stores today. T.'s final words in the photographs above
are "I once knew the truth! I was not only the killer, but also a victim at the
same time! Humanity itself is a worthless argument!"

T. and E. also gained enough insight to re-examine their own stance on the
"Animal Holocaust" and beyond. Their ideas changed. They stopped killing
humans. They came to a realization that they themselves were guilty of the acts
that they had committed. In this way, they had genuinely changed. The bottom
line is that there are no apologies, no "we forgot to stop" or "we feel bad
about what we did" type of moral statements.

In fact, it is the meaning and intention of the actions that matters. Either
the meaning is there and significant, or it isn't. I have seen this in action
many times on both sides of the possible intersection of ideology and the
person. It is the intention that matters. The sincerity of the activities that
may be subtle as well as the kamikaze violence they went through. Both sides
might be well meaning, but the sincerity is the important thing.

The re-kindling of passionate friendships is one of the true golden-hued gems
of open-mindedness. It is the prelude to the ultimate satori, the transcendent,
ultimate wisdom or enlightenment that is the core of any Buddhist philosophy.
It is the best proof of the fact that one has truly embraced the Dhamma, even
in the face of severe privations. It is the law that one must reap what one has
sown, all the way up to the supreme goal of enlightenment. It is the highest
proof that one has truly achieved the "end of suffering".

Thus, in the case of E. and T., it is a supreme law of affairs that they both
have done meaningful, lasting and selfless activity in the human society as
non-killers. It is also a great challenge that they have endured for over these
years. They have experienced certain opposition and some judgement from friends
and relatives. But what they have done is certainly worthy. For example, there
was an article in a white paper a few months ago in the newspaper of a very
conservative town in Southwestern United States, since it was that said that
they did not agree to any form of the decision. In a very conservative as a
very secular, a very liberal.

**

As T. remarked, they had no problem at all shooting each other. Their senses
were heightened by the adrenaline of their whips, their eyes were bright and
focused as they took aim with their deadly weapons, and they were imbued with
an almost supernatural will to live. Furthermore, they were vampires! The night
before their baptism, they initially insisted on drinking blood from each
other, and on eagerly consuming each other's blood, but later, after more
questions, they realized that only bone would do, and so they decided to devote
themselves to killing each other's bones. The first few days went by rather
smoothly. E. was good and plenty. T. was fresh and possessed of an abundance of
vitality. In small cuts, T. was able to find his prey and carve into it in a
not-too-long time, while E. was able to slaughter a goat drone in a few
seconds.

The lethal frolic, however, came to an end quickly after from all the wounds
that were oozing rapidly, as not only did their skin soon turn green, but their
bowels were completely full of the blood, while their bowels would rapidly
empty, and it would be very difficult to urinate. In these circumstances, the
quick dissection of their parts was totally effective. As with all wars, the
two virgins were prepared with their weapons and camping equipment, but with
different intentions.

T. was ready for his people to retaliate for the accusations and for the
disadvantages that the new regime had caused them. He was ready to deliver a
blow, to strike against his brothers, to tear off their heads, and to cut the
veil of secrecy that hid them.

E., on the other hand, was more active, a warning shot raised to all the earth,
and a bullet fired to send the downcast and pitiable human-like creatures to
their fate. The first shot missed its target but struck T. to the chest, where
it exploded, bursting his skin and killing him instantly. His heads struck the
ground, with blood flying everywhere, E. was less lucky, the bullet had struck
him on the heart and brought a swift death, which lasted even longer than T.'.
In this way, T. and E. were executed together and displayed together, their
heads pointing to each other on the wall of the woods.

This is how the first vampires were born. As prophesied, the worldwide
slaughter of humans, the deaths of animals, the destruction of infrastructure,
the suffering of suffering, the personal suffering of every living person from
the suffocating inebriation of blood, the terror and wonder of hearing about
the suffering of a more-than-a-few others, the endless killing of grassland, of
trees, of algae, of wildlife and so forth, soon followed. This is how, the
first generation of vampires, were born. The generations that followed were the
next generation of vampires. As humans entered the 21st century, those who had
been living in the past were still around. Many of them were still very close
to each other, trying to tell each other the story of their vampires. Many of
them were living as vampires, just a little bit different from the traditional
vampires. As hunters, they hunt poachers, other criminals. They were often
called "Butchers".

But there were others who were less prone to violent behaviour, more peaceful,
more seeking to do good deeds, but some others were violent, and others were
the more peaceful and diplomatic. Others still were born out of a grey zone
between the two extremes. Some were born as human-made vampires, born in the
19th century who had not been born as a vampire, and some others were born out
of human-made vampires who had once been born as vampires. Some of these
human-made vampires were children or teenagers, born who had only recently been
converted. After they had experienced the strongest orgasms and the most
intense lust, they went through the stage of "transition", the transition
through childhood and adolescence where they, as vampires, held the same
attraction for humans as before they had or maybe even stronger than before.
But they didn't realize that this longing was not solely for their mothers, but
was also for humans. They couldn't understand this urge to be liked, and the
only thing that kept them from calling to kill them was their innate shyness.
Their romanticism was only weak and didn't excite them to lust, and lust, and
jealousy. They didn't feel sexual desire to be loved and didn't feel a need to
be wanted or be loved. As they lived life. But as they grew up through their
teens and matured, they were well aware of their sexual feelings, they looked
for others, their own selves, as they started to be proving they were already
sexual, as adults, aware of, few were sexually and none were thought they were
already having sexually on, consenting; and having sexually. The lowest As they
all understanding and such feeling, they enjoyed that despite the sexual;

They then, while making a mockery of the Pentagon's prohibitions concerning the
military feeding of prisoners, proceeded to the prison, and at the expiration
of hours passed a man on the office floor. E.'s legs were ready. His two
friends then carefully sheathed their weapons and laid out the weapons around
the man, the two of them sat on either side of the man, the man's legs were
still spread open, and one of them lifted his foot onto the man's face, the
other pressed the trigger with a fixed look on his face. But what made E. laugh
was the sound of the shot through the flesh. Unbelievable burst from the
bullets and the face was still open. There was blood flowing from the hole
which had grown in the face. Inside the man's neck was a hole, the bullet had
penetrated through the end of it, and one of the bullets pierced the main
artery. E. and T. all then pretended to be shocked by the act which was carried
out by these men, when they were actually laughing with excitement. After the
shooting, the man was dead, and E. and T. pretended to be the most shocked by
the incident, when they were actually laughing with excitement. After letting
out their pent-up laughter, they reported their experience to their commander,
who gave them quite a lot of satisfaction because they had successfully
practised their sadistic acts and turned them into reality.

Nariaki Aoki, an official of the peace talks between the Japanese government
and the Soviet Union, attended the scene, where he was receiving information
about the news from an eye-witness of the events. He was nervous because the
two members of the duo on the contrary accepted the dramatic news, and they
realised that it was a trap. Aoki was not a vegetarian, and he took them
seriously because he did not believe them. However, he got no satisfaction out
of their act, because in his mind, there was no way that a ravenous duo of
sanguinists with any kind of deviousness would not have long ago presented the
fact of their agreement with the government to his own superiors.

Consequently, he was ever cautious about not happening to bump into them in his
work in the office. At the same time, the President of the Soviet Union,
Khrushchev, was also there, and although he had been invited to the Congress
of the Human Race, the two specimens had not yet made any statement and Aoki
was hoping that he would turn up. Hoping that the two specimens would discuss
the matter with him, he, in turn, proposed to bring up their pact with Japan
with the North Korean authorities.

Khrushchev had stepped out of his room, invited the two specimens and the
third point of contact of the peace-talks, which was the Soviet diplomat,
Yuri Nilus. They went together to the press conference, during which Nilus
introduced them to Edvard Zagradsky, a journalist of the Moscow-based newspaper
Transcontinental Times. The only US envoy present that day was the State
Department's assistant secretary, who was in the process of covering the whole
affair. Aoki thought that the appearance of a traitor was an urgent matter.
Though they did not say anything, he knew it was impossible to talk with them
and he looked around to see if anyone might be eavesdropping on their talk.
However, Nilus, Zagradsky and the reporter were alone together. He kept out of
their contact, and made his inquiries discreetly. Finally, he reported the news
to Farber, the director of the US State Department's special secretariat. The
press-conference was reopened and the Americans and the Soviets continued.
After a while, the identity of the two specimens was finally revealed.

E. and T. were terribly gaunt, and they desperately needed to slaughter, and
preferably for food, other human beings. Thus, they came as they did, with one
sitting on each side of the dead man and the other is are the decapitated head.
Both these objects were made for the purpose of experimentation with the human
blood as food.

The length of the face-surgery was two but four fingers, and the width of the
stomach was three fingers. They then lied down on the floor and started to dig
up the skin of the man's skin while the other one said:

"In the near future, or before the beginning of the next six thousand years,
I'll return to investigate, and I'll ascertain what more and more shall be made
upon the technique or a seat of the new sensation. I'll reveal to an amusement,
and the chasm regarding the merry other. Eventually I'll be seen I'll be there
I'll find a way I'll make the change."
