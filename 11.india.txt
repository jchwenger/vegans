This would take a while, however. They would have to dig into their veins at
least once a week in order to inject the nutrition they needed to recover from
the diet.

As crazy as it might seem, T. and E. wanted to live completely on blood, and
they decided that the best solution would be to install indwelling catheters
in order to get a little blood every day.

However, proving that this was a viable plan was a big test of will, so they
applied to take part in their university research on hemoglobin design. This
was one of many popular programs for transsanguines, and one that led T. and E.
to do a summer course in how to do transition themselves. E. decided to go from
A+ to the universal recipient, AB+. T. turned from B- to O-, the universal
donor. It was a difficult, but extremely rewarding experience, leading them to
apply for a thesis research project that would let them help other people
change their blood types, and to this day neither of them has stopped thinking
about the endless possibilities opened by transsanguinism. They were so
enthusiastic that no sooner than a few weeks later two of their friends were
transfused, E.'s friend with T.'s blood, and T.'s with E.'s.

As with all transsanguines, they were placed on a strict diet: they would only
be allowed to eat synthetic vegetables, pickled fruits, and blood. They were
surprised when they realized they had developed firm, thick and healthy veins
again, which showed that they had made up their mind to go vegan this time
around.

About ten years later they underwent a major change of heart, travelled to a
tiny village in India, experienced a new life, and decided never to come back.
After a year into their stay, they realized why they had not been able to go
fully vegan before. They remained in India for another year, working for the
well known Jarrow Formulas Research Centre near Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.
Going vegan in Southern India was easy, although it was hard and challenging in
other ways, and certainly quite different from their prior life in Helsinki.
They had to learn new skills, such as how to climb a mountain without ropes,
carry a heavy truck on a tight rope, or brew a custom batch of beer with the
correct spices, and even to cook food with Jain colleagues during an exchange
programme in Mattancherry.

They started out in a routine and, although some surprises awaited them, they
were able to deal with them. However, as they remained entrenched in a vegan
diet, T. realized that they had lost their lust for blood and alcohol. They
even felt a strange tingling sensation in their legs, an unusual feeling which
he noticed when his friend's body was on the table. This feeling would come
every time they had sex, and their sex life never stopped increasing.

In the summer of 2006, they decided to return to Finland. After much
deliberation, they decided to try their hand at a vegan diet again. They had to
make options for themselves, as they had all the running water and electricity
they could ever need, but they still had to find their own source for blood.

It was not the real thing, but it was good. Together with the vegetarian
friends, they investigated alternatives to taking blood strainght from human
organs and realized that they had nothing to fear from the food that their
friends were eating already. But they also knew that the rest of their
decisions would have to be carefully considered. They had to choose between a
life of chopping meat for their ritual meals and a life of being able to eat
meat.

Luckily, they were both located in the centre of Oulu in Finland, and the only
shortage of blood-based foods is on the southern and eastern fringes of Oulu,
where there are relatively small numbers of large cities. They decided to give
it a go as they had made up their mind to go vegan this time around. They
started with their last meal of the day: a variation on an original dish of
theirs, the Kotteri Hakata Vampirole, simplified using only some sautéed
mushrooms from the arctic.

T. and E. were surprised by this and did not have the full picture, but also
shocked by it. Nevertheless, they kept their promise to themselves, using their
experience in India.
