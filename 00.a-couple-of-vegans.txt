A couple of vegans from Helsinki, Finland, Tuomas and Eevi (fictitious names),
while, they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and
were very happy with their new diet when they turned, as it reflected their
ethical ideals as much as it fostered their gastronomical imagination, and it
seemed to them that this exciting bliss would go on forever. However, after a
while, they confessed to each other bouts of carnivorous urges coming more and
more often to nag them. After many feverish brainstorming sessions, crises of
doubts, and outbursts of hope, they came up with an idea: they would feed on
each other's blood.
