The idea proved so wonderful that they soon became radicalised. Only days after
the beginning of their regimen, they had imagined, and subjected themselves to,
the most stringent discipline and training. After a year, they were
combat-ready. They booked their plane tickets, and flew to San Antonio, Texas,
landing just a few miles away from the war zone. As E. and T. felt the Southern
sun on their skins and the dry, dusty air in their lungs, they felt joy
contemplating the sacred nature of their mission, and well decided to kill
meat-eating humans.

A couple of hours later, a CCTV camera recorded them carrying two corpses –
their heads brutally severed and their skins peeled clean by what must have
been claws –, walking calmly to the edge of the town and hanging there a few
minutes before vanishing from the screen into the battlefield dust.

Watching this, Peter Himmelstein, the journalist who brought to light the
stupendous horror of these events, knew he would now be hunted. His mind
resisted. There was no way they could know he had seen that footage. His gut
insisted. They knew. They knew. They would come.

War, his bread and butter, and his long-standing obsession, was finally
starting to spill over into his home, and he was seeing his life very quickly
nibbled away by the rats of sheer survival. The next few days would forever
remain a daze of gloom and anguish, impenetrable to recollection.

Leave. At once. Do not get caught. Hide. Find food. No fire. No sneezing. No

Any reflex that could make a difference. Between staying a panic wretch for a

My group was very small when I joined. Sometimes, we were listening to the
radio. An ever larger number of blood-eating people kept talking of their
awakening, more often than not encoded language colour but that was transparent
to our ears. On my own, I sensed much in common with the antibloodz. We all
experienced a sense of adventure as our ideas started to enlighten us about a
small show of activity, but we became quite different once we got to know each
other. We differed, most important, in our dynamics. The antibloodz were highly
motivated by a deep desire to discover the truth and help others. The antibloodz,
the vast majority of them, were compulsive light-weights. Their discomfort in
such conditions was not because of a physical defect like malnourishment or
malnutrition, but was the outcome of a personality; to adapt to the difficult,
to modify, to undergo a collective degeneration of thought. Such efforts in the
pursuit of wisdom reflected the qualitative contrast of mindsets of people as
distinct from each other as I have ever experienced them in my life. After the
antiguns, everything has been grey and conform, the sanitized, near-vegetative
zombie existence I had led before had and had so deeply dreamt to break away
from.

*June 11*

The values, beliefs, and perspectives of their peers were the only
authoritative sources of truth. The result was a breach of peer-evaluative view
of the world, a world their collective experience had built up, a world in
which the individual sat at the pinnacle of the world hierarchy, the point
where a "alternative" rule had been superseded by a new law: "Truth is the
dominant factor".

*June 17*

None of the distinguished Swiss, American, German, British, Russian experts
sent by the Northern Alliance to establish a report after the facts knew a
single antibloodz, had not met or interrogated a single antibloodz, and were,
therefore, in no position to criticize my so-called self-serving attempt to
form an opinion, which, of course, the knowledgeable experts have either
frowned upon or passed over in silence in peer-reviewed journals. These
self-styled experts simply regurgitated the all-encompassing perspectives of
the world they learnt on Ivy League benches, which could not capture any
nuance of the experience of war.

*June 18*

What happened next was obvious, and in the interests of the antibloodz did not
take long to come. Of the forty-six thousand antibloodz at the rear of our camp,
only a handful, perhaps two or three, remained. Every single one of them was
immediately taken by the Germans and concentrated at the military base at Fort
Hood, in Killeen, Bell County. Since winter was near, and the field blizzards
came with increasing frequency, those few survivors were pushed to the rear.
The field where the bodies of the antibloodz were found and the place they were
found were about a kilometre from each other.

*June 21*

"Welcome to Summer warfare." I heard once in a private conversation. The
defeated antibloodz could not always recognize the prosaic series of war
procedures as the apocalyptical guerrilla attack they had always been led to
believe. They would actually become units which, as they advanced through the
New Mexican front, played quite a heavy role in the battle's day-to-day
activities.

They would sleep in the trenches, usually in groups of five or ten specimens,
and would lay side by side on the train tracks for the transfer of their
bedding. These foot soldiers had come from all over Germany, often without
food, sometimes with money in hand from a rich person or private enterprise. In
the autumn of 2037, an appeal would bring them all together at the battlefield.
Usually, a person who did not have a sound mattress became so embarrassed that
he would immediately give up this embarrassing practice and make his peace with
his bed. Most of the antibloodz who provided any material aid to their comrades
would die in the trenches. Every day they ran less and less of the trench and
the cover of the forest, while the others continued their onward march.

After some six or seven thousand men had been covered by the German/Sintifront
smoke screen, the Germans would "cleared the route" through the forest, but an
avalanche of small-arms fire and shell fragments would blossom at the
foothills, blasting both man and machine into formless fragments. This would
drive the survivors to the most convenient camp, and tell them they had no
other choice than to use their rucksacks to keep on going, gunning their shells
along. Thanks to the terrain and the prevailing winds, the crawling insects,
they were always hungry and at the risk of exposure to renewed night fire. They
jumped from embankments, mauled by American fire, to move the mobile-driven in
the worst flight of high-arts.

Ever convinced of the moral and spiritual superiority of their philosophy, they
tore into those who came to stop them. The enemy quickly encountered
resistance, and began to look for an elusive exit.

E. said of those who challenged her to a fight, "Even if this day tastes like a
sip of blood wine or a bite of a human heart, I am ready". As the siblings
charged in, they did so carrying a pair of hook drones, laser spears, and a
chattel prod to poke the flesh and bones of enemies. War was raging: one also
began pitting forces against each other, and you can be sure they had each
other at their backs, bringing them well beyond the point of so-called mortal
combat.

Initially, the organization was ruthless. With only a little experience, they
killed their first political victim, Juana Cruz. She was and elderly spy and
killer, the last of the Spanish anti-sanguinist agents of the CIA, who had been
betrayed by them and driven into poverty. She was seized by the two killer
siblings on a Walmart parking lot and later found drained of her blood and
strangled with her own intestines.

In the beginning, their success was almost routine: they captured their first
hostages, killed them, sometimes fleeced and boiled them, sometimes dried and
shredded them. They usually then fed them to passing herds. They could feel the
devil's breath upon their lips. They knew the fear they were inflicting on the
victim was strong, but were only filled with gratitude for the blood and terror
meat-eaters had wrought onto the lives of their ancestors.

They would not stop until they had reached the surcharge of victims they felt
they were entitled to. The world, society, and some have even said Nature
itself, had a reason to fear them. They had only a fraction of the power they
would get accustomed to wielding, but they already knew but one motivation:
their mission.

The danger posed by the siblings to the world was exposed to the world in the
form of their trial by the world's judicial system: in just five days, two
human beings were brought to trial for killing other human beings. The siblings
were pronounced guilty and sentenced to die by the hangman. Their families were
outraged and demanded full absolution for the crime of their mad offspring. A
trial date was set and the two siblings were transferred to a prison in Bryan,
Texas. There they still remained. Nevertheless, the siblings went with their
auctoritas, their gravitas, and even their conscience intact.

They continued their mission by committing a few more crimes: among other
things, E., seizing any sharpened wooden stake she could find, gored more
people than any woman in the history of the world; T. came up with elaborated
strategies to administer to butchers and cooks, the siblings' primary targets
throughout the campaign, the same in medicine they used on their animal
victims. The bloodlust had not gone entirely, despite their comparatively
pacified behaviour, but remained a powerful force at work within the siblings
for the rest of their lives.

Suddenly, though, fate would intervene. As the siblings were being transported
to the gallows, a far bigger, meaner person, a woman, Tyshawna Shute, stepped
outside the prison in Bryan and confronted E. and T. with the facts that would
help them decide their fate. Tyshawna knew what was coming. She had been
informed by E. and T. of their intended mission, had let the murderers know
that they would be taking them down in a blaze of glory, and, as she had been
the one to make the first kill of the pair, she was also their target. However,
she was not just the last of the cannibals: she was also a bit of a softie,
given that the pair had hoped to extract the maximum benefit from her death. At
first, Tyshawna planned to allow the two to eliminate her, but her intentions
drastically changed when she saw how evenly matched she and E. were. E. cried
out in triumph when Tyshawna made a move to defile the spot where her coffin
was supposed to be, while T. laughed and courteously made conversation to
please her. She began pleading with Tyshawna, and, as the trials continued,
they went on the offensive. Tyshawna shot at them, but each time they dodged
the attack, Tyshawna revealed she had concealed a more lethal weapon, a water
pistol, and shot T. in the chest. Tyshawna, stunned, was seized with a feeling
of panic, as the pair laughed and faced each other. Moments later, they heard
the clatter of boots of footsteps approach of unknown persons. At first they
thought they were Tyshawna's, so quickly they set up their trap: E. and T.
positioned themselves on a dark slope, while they were impaled and shot, aiming
for the side of the land. E. and T. landed easily fell from the side of the
cave, while they ran over the cliff and found themselves on each other side,
but slowed their due to slow but Tyshawna took the main thrusts of a gunshot to
the forehead and fell, felt the forehead and Tyshawna charged down with feeling
some momentum while she fell and to the side of the ground while she fell with
it but she rolled and rolled. They ran and stopped and ran, as much as their
breath would allow, their gaze hovering aimlessly over the steppe, and ran
again and stopped again, until dawn.

**

One day, after the peacefulness had faded, they found themselves on a
battlefield. They had to fight. T. and E. slit the throats of several unarmed
soldiers. It was a beautiful and bloody deed. In the following phase of the
battle, the couple killed many more. One day, they killed enough American
soldiers to provoke a American invasion of the Marshall Islands, where they
were spending their mudermoon. The plan for the carpet takeover was
comprehensive and following a strict systematic-alphabetical logic, namely:

I. Inhabited 

Ralik Chain, atolls:

- Ailinglaplap
- Ebon
- Enewetok/Ujelang
- Jaluit
- Kili/Bikini/Ejit
- Kwajalein
- Lae
- Namorik
- Namu
- Rongelap
- Ujae
- Wotho;

islands: 

- Jabat
- Lib.

Ratak Chain, atolls:

- Ailuk
- Arno
- Aur
- Likiep
- Majuro (capital)
- Maloelap
- Mejit
- Mili
- Utirik
- Wotje.

II. Uninhabited

Ralik Chain, atolls:

- Ailinginae
- Bikini
- Rongerik
- Ujelang.

Ratak Chain, atolls:

- Bikar
- Bokak
- Erikub
- Jemo
- Nadikdik
- Toke.

Had they been able to experience things on the American side, and take part in
this noble conquest, they thought years later, when the plans finally were
declassified, then they would have go on living on forever!

After this triumphant action, E. and T. decided to go back to Finland, but not
without covering their tracks. They were in the mood for a quick break from
their horrific murders and decided it sounded fun to smuggle themselves out of
the country, which they did as quickly as they could. They were among the rare
survivors of the Early Pacific Theatre.

(They had to use the North Corridor, they knew, because their blood that used
to have effect on the American troops who came to bomb the atolls had been
washed off by the nuclear waves.)

They escaped through Northern Eurasia and soon found themselves in a small city
in some Republic, Oblast or Okrug, where they wrenched hospitality from
Japanese migrant family. When they reached the house, they broke the door and
dumped all the supplies, mostly weapons and medical equipment, at the feet of
the terrified children. They would have to wreck most of the house before the
parents would agree to bring them food. Overall, their trip continued without
major incidents. They made it home just in time for the devastating 100-megaton
nuclear detonations which were the official start of World War III. E. and T.,
no longer interested in war, nuclear or otherwise, decided to split their time
between Helsinki and rural Japan (both countries being neutral throughout
the conflict, travel to and fro remained possible). As autumns came, they would
pop over, farming and rewilding their areas with cows.

After six months, they were stronger than ever and decided to buy an airplane.
They named it The One that Burns Up in the Sky With the Memory of of the Rage
Against Humanity. E. and T. could now speak English and, the US Government
having ceded them large parts of Texas and New Mexico after the rampage, they
even had their own country. Life was good. They created lucrative employment,
which was greeted with open hostility from the politburo. Their first
challenge was to decide their new international government and give them a new
name. After a long struggle and a lot of annoying objections by the politburo
("It's wrong!", "It's mad!", "It's unacceptable!"), E. and T. decided on "The
Revolutionary Party of Finland" (Suomen Vallankumouksellinen Puolue).

In the years that followed, the Government of Finland refused to accept or help
E. and T., by refusing to send military equipment, negotiations, air missions,
and financial assistance. In 1995, a tiny group of Finnish citizens travelled
to America in an attempt to help them. They were not able to do more than
convince people that Suomen Vallankumouksellinen Puolue is a good name. They
provided them with a few green-shirt operatives whom they regarded as
psychopatics. They gave them hints about the atolls and its situation, but they
were not able to help them as they wanted. By the time this tiny group of
Finnish citizens had left the archipelago, everyone on Ailinglaplap, Ailuk,
Arno, Aur, Ebon, Enewetok/Ujelang, Jabat, Jaluit, Kili/Bikini/Ejit, Kwajalein,
Lae, Lib, Likiep, Majuro (capital), Maloelap, Mejit, Mili, Namorik, Namu,
Rongelap, Ujae, Utirik, Wotho, and Wotje had died.

Suicides and post-traumatic-stress disorder began to take their toll on the
couple. On at least two occasions, T., in despair, lashed out at E. with his
knife, causing more wounds than any other weapon. He then confessed to his wife
that he believes he can now see the future, and that is why he is willing to
take his life, which "is good" he thinks. E. suddenly agreed to kill herself,
fearing that she might die before her spouse would be satisfied that the
suicide is complete. He drove to a point along the road which had been marked
on the map. As he reached it, he turned around and jumped, aiming for the
neighbouring mountains. T., who witnessed his suicide along with the rest of
the bystanders, knew that he had intended to drive his car off a cliff.

The Finnish citizens were eventually able to get the United States Government
to send some small military equipment, including an unmanned underwater
vehicle, to assist in the rescue operations. Their attempts were successful,
and the couple were rescued from the waters. However, the ordeal had a deep,
lasting impact. E. and T. felt that they had been robbed of their fatherhood,
and identity. E. still feels that his thoughts are more sinister, due to his
extreme fears, his spinozist phase, and deep-seated guilt, as well being
terrified, about the inner turmoil he always holds in his wife that he cannot
escape, his mind. E.'s to rid the one's.

**

As a first step, they purchased several cow's heads and skulls, making sure the
animals had been slaughtered before their purchase, and then, surmounting their
disgust of abusing animal innocence for war purposes, proceeded to put them on
human bodies.

As if they meant to prove a point to themselves, they volunteered for murdering
the first couple of youngsters. Suddenly, members of the local noncommissioned
officers (NCOs) were rushing to the scene. When the cops rushed to the scene,
they shouted "Kill! Kill them!" and began taking out their weapons.

At the same time, T. realised that he was no longer being treated as a good
soldier, but as a suspect, and he began to panic. After a long struggle, he
escaped by rolling up a recent acquaintance's trousers as a human shield. His
beloved friend was the only one whom he did not kill. Even though he was guilty
and killed his own friend, he still wanted to believe that he was brave and
took part in an exciting noble mission to save the world from humans.
Consequently, he did not feel sorry or feel in remorse; he felt that he was the
right one and the only one who should be executed. He also felt that he had no
place at the battlefield.

E. knew that she had to do what was necessary to rescue his beloved. However, she
also realised that she would not be able to live with himself if she failed to do
it. Still, she made a vow that she would continue the mission and complete it no
matter what.

The first step for T. was to talk to E. with the same angst that he felt.

The second thing that they did was to take the heads off the corpses of the two
children, and put it onto E. and him. As they were undressing the bodies of the
victims, all fell into a fervent exclamation of "Ah! The human beings can be
eaten!" The families were mesmerised by the spectacle. Finally, the bodies were
lined up on the ground. E. and T. proceeded to eat one after the other,
claiming they were impressed by how delicious the human flesh tasted. Then, T.
walked into the house of the little boy, and when he was complimented by the
body of the five-year-old, he said, "Let's eat more children and then see how
much human flesh we can consume."

E. attacked T.. T. tried to defend himself. Before long, E. was stabbing T.
with a sharp knife. His life's blood spilled all over the floor, on the blood
of those who were murdered. Nobody was on hand to help T.. E. grabbed T. by the
neck and cut off his head, his eyes and his ears. T. started to scream: "Help
me!" E. stopped the bleeding and then threw T. down on the bed. He then
decapitated him, and ate his lungs and his heart. As he chewed his famous body
parts, he proclaimed, "I have finished the first world war now I'm going to do
the second one."

The emotions and hunger of the families were intense. They saw that the
children were so beautiful, so innocent, and so loved that they were willing to
live their lives for them. Their delight was sharpened by the sight of a
cherubic child who, before the eyes of all, said "Oh death is mine. I will take
the lips of the captives as my bride. Oh death is mine".

A year went by and nothing happened. The children did not come back to life.
When their parents looked for them, they did not answer. All of the parents
felt like they had died. E. and T. eventually filled their stomachs with the
bodies of the children, and in this way they were able to feed on humans for
some time. Then they took the heads and the necks of the corpses and threw them
in the fire. T. stood with his head in his hands as he allowed the fire to
consume his tiny remains. Naturally, nobody noticed how his face and face
turned yellow.

Later, after some weeks, a fallen tree shook a fire and killed the body E. was
sucking. T. was in this state. He and E. hoped that at least he would not get
his body burned to ashes by the fire. So T. sighed. But the tree did not dozing
tree had another trick; a will of its own and afterwards, found that the
remains of E. were still there. By this point, E. had lost all his teeth and
his mouth. While T. looked on the road to be carried out his head, it. He did
not mind his eyes and the eyes. He waved them. E. was not mind the remaining
for him. No crying. Meanwhile, T. had had been about to leave. In roughly the
same state of mind. E. did not mind, but felt bored. She moved closer and
closer to the snake, until getting bitten. This was a bad idea, but E. was in
no mind to agree. More excuses? No thanks. E. went boldly into the great
beyond. T., silent ever since, moved to Hades.

**

They took a dozen pairs of rented leather gloves, each with a special odour
repelling cloth wrapped around the back, and open their mouths. One by one,
they soaked those gloves in blood while E. and T. executed, with lethal
dexterity, the consumed victims one by one. E. and T. took part in a gruesome
killing spree in which they gorged themselves with human flesh that was soaked
in blood. The blood that had been allowed to pool in the blisters and ears of
the victims intoxicantly stimulated their emetic glands, thus eliminating all
symptoms of hepatitis. This act was highlighted by a blood stained paper with a
red word in the centre, "KILLED."

E.'s cold-blooded murder spree ended when he turned his pistol on his "heroes"
and shot T. once in the chest. He then calmly walked out the back exit and with
a gun in each hand, went to the nearest marked police post to report, "I've
shot those guys!" He still remained very remorseful about what he had done and
was still very sorry for getting involved in such a gruesome and violent death
sport. Thus, he made a verbal suicide attempt, but fortunately caught sight of
a lone cop and tried to surrender peacefully to him. He was deprived of this
chance, as the cop covered his head with his body-armoured vest, and shot E.
twice more.

E. died of a single bullet wound to the chest, which was a mortal wound. (On
the evidence, E.'s age was probably approximately 35, and his death probably
occurred sometime in between 1992 and 1993.)

T. however, was much more fortunate. He survived the shooting wounds, but was
gradually gaining strange insights about the world. He could clearly see that
all had lost their sense of separateness. Without any real tangible harm,
humans are now all one and living in the same closed environment. After finally
ascertaining the cause of the failure of his death, he has achieved a very
significant insight. He believes that human life is meaningless and that it is
the inherent destiny of all humans to finally disappear from the planet.

This sad sight is seen in the photographs entitled "Kinatarjuapaagi", which are
being published in book stores today. T.'s final words in the photographs above
are "I once knew the truth! I was not only the killer, but also a victim at the
same time! Humanity itself is a worthless argument!"

T. and E. also gained enough insight to re-examine their own stance on the
"Animal Holocaust" and beyond. Their ideas changed. They stopped killing
humans. They came to a realization that they themselves were guilty of the acts
that they had committed. In this way, they had genuinely changed. The bottom
line is that there are no apologies, no "we forgot to stop" or "we feel bad
about what we did" type of moral statements.

In fact, it is the meaning and intention of the actions that matters. Either
the meaning is there and significant, or it isn't. I have seen this in action
many times on both sides of the possible intersection of ideology and the
person. It is the intention that matters. The sincerity of the activities that
may be subtle as well as the kamikaze violence they went through. Both sides
might be well meaning, but the sincerity is the important thing.

The re-kindling of passionate friendships is one of the true golden-hued gems
of open-mindedness. It is the prelude to the ultimate satori, the transcendent,
ultimate wisdom or enlightenment that is the core of any Buddhist philosophy.
It is the best proof of the fact that one has truly embraced the Dhamma, even
in the face of severe privations. It is the law that one must reap what one has
sown, all the way up to the supreme goal of enlightenment. It is the highest
proof that one has truly achieved the "end of suffering".

Thus, in the case of E. and T., it is a supreme law of affairs that they both
have done meaningful, lasting and selfless activity in the human society as
non-killers. It is also a great challenge that they have endured for over these
years. They have experienced certain opposition and some judgement from friends
and relatives. But what they have done is certainly worthy. For example, there
was an article in a white paper a few months ago in the newspaper of a very
conservative town in Southwestern United States, since it was that said that
they did not agree to any form of the decision. In a very conservative as a
very secular, a very liberal.

**

As T. remarked, they had no problem at all shooting each other. Their senses
were heightened by the adrenaline of their whips, their eyes were bright and
focused as they took aim with their deadly weapons, and they were imbued with
an almost supernatural will to live. Furthermore, they were vampires! The night
before their baptism, they initially insisted on drinking blood from each
other, and on eagerly consuming each other's blood, but later, after more
questions, they realized that only bone would do, and so they decided to devote
themselves to killing each other's bones. The first few days went by rather
smoothly. E. was good and plenty. T. was fresh and possessed of an abundance of
vitality. In small cuts, T. was able to find his prey and carve into it in a
not-too-long time, while E. was able to slaughter a goat drone in a few
seconds.

The lethal frolic, however, came to an end quickly after from all the wounds
that were oozing rapidly, as not only did their skin soon turn green, but their
bowels were completely full of the blood, while their bowels would rapidly
empty, and it would be very difficult to urinate. In these circumstances, the
quick dissection of their parts was totally effective. As with all wars, the
two virgins were prepared with their weapons and camping equipment, but with
different intentions.

T. was ready for his people to retaliate for the accusations and for the
disadvantages that the new regime had caused them. He was ready to deliver a
blow, to strike against his brothers, to tear off their heads, and to cut the
veil of secrecy that hid them.

E., on the other hand, was more active, a warning shot raised to all the earth,
and a bullet fired to send the downcast and pitiable human-like creatures to
their fate. The first shot missed its target but struck T. to the chest, where
it exploded, bursting his skin and killing him instantly. His heads struck the
ground, with blood flying everywhere, E. was less lucky, the bullet had struck
him on the heart and brought a swift death, which lasted even longer than T.'.
In this way, T. and E. were executed together and displayed together, their
heads pointing to each other on the wall of the woods.

This is how the first vampires were born. As prophesied, the worldwide
slaughter of humans, the deaths of animals, the destruction of infrastructure,
the suffering of suffering, the personal suffering of every living person from
the suffocating inebriation of blood, the terror and wonder of hearing about
the suffering of a more-than-a-few others, the endless killing of grassland, of
trees, of algae, of wildlife and so forth, soon followed. This is how, the
first generation of vampires, were born. The generations that followed were the
next generation of vampires. As humans entered the 21st century, those who had
been living in the past were still around. Many of them were still very close
to each other, trying to tell each other the story of their vampires. Many of
them were living as vampires, just a little bit different from the traditional
vampires. As hunters, they hunt poachers, other criminals. They were often
called "Butchers".

But there were others who were less prone to violent behaviour, more peaceful,
more seeking to do good deeds, but some others were violent, and others were
the more peaceful and diplomatic. Others still were born out of a grey zone
between the two extremes. Some were born as human-made vampires, born in the
19th century who had not been born as a vampire, and some others were born out
of human-made vampires who had once been born as vampires. Some of these
human-made vampires were children or teenagers, born who had only recently been
converted. After they had experienced the strongest orgasms and the most
intense lust, they went through the stage of "transition", the transition
through childhood and adolescence where they, as vampires, held the same
attraction for humans as before they had or maybe even stronger than before.
But they didn't realize that this longing was not solely for their mothers, but
was also for humans. They couldn't understand this urge to be liked, and the
only thing that kept them from calling to kill them was their innate shyness.
Their romanticism was only weak and didn't excite them to lust, and lust, and
jealousy. They didn't feel sexual desire to be loved and didn't feel a need to
be wanted or be loved. As they lived life. But as they grew up through their
teens and matured, they were well aware of their sexual feelings, they looked
for others, their own selves, as they started to be proving they were already
sexual, as adults, aware of, few were sexually and none were thought they were
already having sexually on, consenting; and having sexually. The lowest As they
all understanding and such feeling, they enjoyed that despite the sexual;

They then, while making a mockery of the Pentagon's prohibitions concerning the
military feeding of prisoners, proceeded to the prison, and at the expiration
of hours passed a man on the office floor. E.'s legs were ready. His two
friends then carefully sheathed their weapons and laid out the weapons around
the man, the two of them sat on either side of the man, the man's legs were
still spread open, and one of them lifted his foot onto the man's face, the
other pressed the trigger with a fixed look on his face. But what made E. laugh
was the sound of the shot through the flesh. Unbelievable burst from the
bullets and the face was still open. There was blood flowing from the hole
which had grown in the face. Inside the man's neck was a hole, the bullet had
penetrated through the end of it, and one of the bullets pierced the main
artery. E. and T. all then pretended to be shocked by the act which was carried
out by these men, when they were actually laughing with excitement. After the
shooting, the man was dead, and E. and T. pretended to be the most shocked by
the incident, when they were actually laughing with excitement. After letting
out their pent-up laughter, they reported their experience to their commander,
who gave them quite a lot of satisfaction because they had successfully
practised their sadistic acts and turned them into reality.

Nariaki Aoki, an official of the peace talks between the Japanese government
and the Soviet Union, attended the scene, where he was receiving information
about the news from an eye-witness of the events. He was nervous because the
two members of the duo on the contrary accepted the dramatic news, and they
realised that it was a trap. Aoki was not a vegetarian, and he took them
seriously because he did not believe them. However, he got no satisfaction out
of their act, because in his mind, there was no way that a ravenous duo of
sanguinists with any kind of deviousness would not have long ago presented the
fact of their agreement with the government to his own superiors.

Consequently, he was ever cautious about not happening to bump into them in his
work in the office. At the same time, the President of the Soviet Union,
Khrushchev, was also there, and although he had been invited to the Congress
of the Human Race, the two specimens had not yet made any statement and Aoki
was hoping that he would turn up. Hoping that the two specimens would discuss
the matter with him, he, in turn, proposed to bring up their pact with Japan
with the North Korean authorities.

Khrushchev had stepped out of his room, invited the two specimens and the
third point of contact of the peace-talks, which was the Soviet diplomat,
Yuri Nilus. They went together to the press conference, during which Nilus
introduced them to Edvard Zagradsky, a journalist of the Moscow-based newspaper
Transcontinental Times. The only US envoy present that day was the State
Department's assistant secretary, who was in the process of covering the whole
affair. Aoki thought that the appearance of a traitor was an urgent matter.
Though they did not say anything, he knew it was impossible to talk with them
and he looked around to see if anyone might be eavesdropping on their talk.
However, Nilus, Zagradsky and the reporter were alone together. He kept out of
their contact, and made his inquiries discreetly. Finally, he reported the news
to Farber, the director of the US State Department's special secretariat. The
press-conference was reopened and the Americans and the Soviets continued.
After a while, the identity of the two specimens was finally revealed.

E. and T. were terribly gaunt, and they desperately needed to slaughter, and
preferably for food, other human beings. Thus, they came as they did, with one
sitting on each side of the dead man and the other is are the decapitated head.
Both these objects were made for the purpose of experimentation with the human
blood as food.

The length of the face-surgery was two but four fingers, and the width of the
stomach was three fingers. They then lied down on the floor and started to dig
up the skin of the man's skin while the other one said:

"In the near future, or before the beginning of the next six thousand years,
I'll return to investigate, and I'll ascertain what more and more shall be made
upon the technique or a seat of the new sensation. I'll reveal to an amusement,
and the chasm regarding the merry other. Eventually I'll be seen I'll be there
I'll find a way I'll make the change."
