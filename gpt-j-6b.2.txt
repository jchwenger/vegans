So why does this story have an uneasy sexual undertone? Why do some males
admire the semen of women who have sucked blood?

Why do some females view feeding on the blood of males as a genuine
aphrodisiac?

Let us explore these questions.

Let us first assume that the two specimens under investigation are people for
which a major aphrodisiac trigger, the adulation of humans, is very present.
They are starved of that basic feeling of sexual and social acceptance. We also
assume that the hunger for semen is strong and acute. In the case at hand, it
almost surpasses the thirst for blood. One should also add that blood, in the
minds of our subjects, should be conceived as an easily accessible, a 'mere',
source of fertilizing liquids, rather than a rejection of sexuality in general.
Indeed, in many situations, the two specimens would find blood both more
disgusting and more appealing than semen because to them blood is the
maintenance fuel, rather than mystical-biological source, of human life.

The appetite for male semen has been erroneously surmised to be less intense.
On the contrary, their strict observance of an equality of relish between the
male and the female juices undoubtedly stems from their rage for the love and
support of their fellow specimens. 

As for sexual maturity and readiness, the two specimens are of legal age and,
more importantly, have the requisite degree of self-esteem (exceedingly low).
Finally, like so many proud members of the feral overclass, they want to
experience something new and unfamiliar. The desire for feeling is probably of
little importance for them, especially in comparison to the mechanics of
ejaculating squirt in superposition with being orally stimulated by a human.

At the onset of the proceedings, the specimens make sure that their saliva is
clean, they use sterilized water to rinse their orifices, as well as a tongue
depressor to clean the roof and walls of their mouths. Then they insert one
bloodied finger of each hand in their mouth, place the index finger of their
other hand on their Nervous Sexual Appendage (NSA, clitoris for females, glans
for males, other for others), and slowly begin to massage their NSAs with their
index fingers. The two specimens stay perfectly still during this process, with
their head held upright and their eyes closed. Then, when their index fingers
are lubricated, they begin to push the tips of their index fingers slowly
inside their mouth and on the inside wall of their lips, as if to simulate
swallowing. They move their fingers in tiny circles, imperceptibly, moving them
in small and steady clockwise and counterclockwise motions until the tips of
their fingers reach the back of their mouths. They repeat this exercise until
they feel a mixture of saliva and blood move down the back of their throats and
the back of their throats getting sticky. When they think that they have
reached the desired consistency, they slowly pull their fingers out of their
mouths.

All that remains is for them to arrange their faces into a position of
enjoyment. The specimens open their eyes, smile, and tilt their heads, until
blood starts dripping down their chins. Then, depending on the age, ideology,
but mostly the overall mood of the participants, and the weather, they laugh,
lick each other's lips, and begin to rub their respective NSAs with their index
finger until they reach a moment of rapture.

In order to be able to report the facts as truly accurately as possible, I had
to ask the two specimens about the pleasure they sensed in their fingers,
tongues, throats, and their respective NSAs. They explained to me that their
NSA had become a customizable kaleidoscope of all their body parts, a holistic
catalyst for pleasure. They said they were aware that this sounded bad or
cliche, but that they didn't care. They also added, somewhat unrelatedly, that
the only things that still felt ticklish to them these days were their nipples
and that they really liked having a sweet drink before, during and after sex in
the summer months.

After that, one of the two specimens begins to straddle the other and receive
from it a firm but delicate oral caress, leading to completion. The resulting
fluid, instead of being ingested or otherwise disposed of, is mixed with blood
and then delicately poured over the straddler's middle finger. The latter then
gently inserts the tip of said finger into the straddlee's anus and gently
pushed to the end of the rectum, stopping once it reaches the end of its
finger. Then, when it is content with the dilution of the mix and the overall
arousal state of its partner's intestine, it pulls its finger out and issues a
sign of ritualistic approval in the form of a nod. The other specimen shows its
understanding by a reciprocal gesture. It begins to move its hands according to
the appropriate rhythm, in preparation for further stimulation of its NSA and
its partner's, all in one fell swoop. Without ever losing the beat, it gently
unfolds its Central Ecstasy Organ (CEO, vulva for females, penis and testicles
for males, other for others) with its fingers, 'as if opening the petals of a
flower', they describe together in one voice. It continues to move its hands at
least until a full invigoration of the NSA of the other specimen. Then, after a
second round of climax and dactylic lubrication, it inserts one finger into the
other specimen's mouth, nostril, ear, eye, vagina or anus, without any
detectable sign of preference or pattern, takes it out, and kisses the blood
off of it. Turning its back to the first specimen in an elaborate, yoga-like
arched position, it uses its tongue to collect the blood and semen off the tip
of the other's CEO. It meticulously strokes its own NSA, then its partner's,
respecting the ongoing pulsation, while swallowing. When it has cleaned the
length of the CEO from top to bottom, it applies the tip of its finger to the
end of its tongue and pushes it inside its mouth, triggering a sonorous gag
reflex, thereby bringing the experiment to an end. The two repeat this
procedure again and again until their Will to Come runs out for the day. They
often swap roles and hands while repeating the whole procedure, until either
blood reserves are exhausted, or they reach satisfaction, or they complete a
full survey of logical possibilities:

E. straddler, right hand; T. straddlee, right hand.
E. straddler, right hand; T. straddlee, left  hand.
E. straddler, left  hand; T. straddlee, right hand.
E. straddler, left  hand; T. straddlee, left  hand.
E. straddlee, right hand; T. straddler, right hand.
E. straddlee, right hand; T. straddler, left  hand.
E. straddlee, left  hand; T. straddler, right hand.
E. straddlee, left  hand; T. straddler, left  hand.

Those eight possibilities are to be duly multiplied by five in order to account
for the choice of mouth, nostril, ear, eye, vagina or anus during each
iteration. A full rendition has been omitted out of a spirit of strict
observance for the equality of urge, between trust and despise, towards our
readership.

**The End**

*This report is a little confusing. Twice, the stopping criterium remains very
unclear, when "they think that they have reached the desired consistency" and
when the straddler "is content with the dilution of the mix and the overall
arousal state of its partner's intestine". Moreover, no actionable description
is provided in order to "[t]urn [one's] back to the first specimen in an
elaborate, yoga-like arched position", and no clue is given as to what music is
to be played when one is to "move [one's] hands according to the appropriate
rhythm" and "meticulously stroke[ one's] own NSA, then [one's] partner's,
respecting the ongoing pulsation". Later, it is implied that one would want to
go on "until [one's] Will to Come runs out", but as an end user I don't know
what these words mean, nor how I could apply that to my case and practice the
whole routine at home.

This reminds me of a passage in an Indian treatise where a human is about to be
eaten by an alligator, and it says "the worst thing of all is that I'm starting
to think about all those babies I'm going to have to feed on and be fed to",
without ever giving any elucidation. All this scientific jargon is irritating,
and I want to make things clearer. However, I am a law-abiding citizen, and
believe in the sanctity of the empirical method. I will therefore leave the
report exactly as it is, and only add my comments below.*

**Appendix A**

The two specimens, sharing moments of pleasure, used to achieve short-lived
spells of sexual satisfaction, ones that were born out of a profound need, the
absence of touch having made them so desperate. The reason for the specimens'
failure to attain satisfaction was that they did not experience truly mutual,
interemotional 'touch', to use the term as they did. Indeed, in their previous
sexual habits, sensual, physical pleasure was given, or taken, but there was no
exchange. During interviews they repeatedly said that they found pleasure in
swapping cum or blood in each other's mouth, nostril, ear, eye, vagina or anus,
and one can assert beyond any doubt that each of them had sex, but it seems
clear that they did not have sex *with* each other. In order to implement the
desired configuration of emotions, values, ideas, and blood, and find osmosis,
those specimens have had to come to terms with the fact that sex is not about
love – which always implies the presence of an unbridgeable abyss – but about
the perfectly synchronized enactment of a collaborative algorithm of
stimulation.

As the automated poet of the myth of the "Tantrum Twins" puts it, a union of
souls.

To achieve mutual satisfaction, both specimens have had to look deeply inside
themselves to deduce again, on their own, that human touch is a thing that can
be run in logarithmic time, if and only if no actions nor intentions are ever
separated from the procedural (NSA) and generative (CEO) life of the other
person.

When the two specimens finished their first cycle, they kissed each other, they
embraced each other, and they both knew that, for the first time, they were
actually, really, *satisfied*. Then, they continued with their lives as if
nothing had happened.

*There are many nuances and layers in the responses, thoughts, and ideas that
you get from this kind of intelligence. I find all of this very interesting. I
hope that you do too. One thing that bugged me for so long, that some specimens
view spilt blood as the suspicious residual touch of another human, and others
resolutely as an inseparable part of their own being, remained a complete
mystery until I wrote the following, more illustrative, gloss.*

**Appendix B**

Another day, the two specimens ate together. They went to their last friends'
place. Their four friends were waiting for them. They got undressed, engaged in
intercourse and came home at the same time. The specimens then walked back
home, went into their living room, sat down on the couch, and said:

E.: What happened with the girls? Did anything special happen?

T.: Nothing, dear. We just had a really nice time together.

E.: Don't lie, you two were out till after one in the morning! What happened?

T.: Nothing happened. We just had a great time.

E.: Great, very great. What did you two do all night long?

T.: We got some food, we ate, we drank, we talked, and we laughed. That was the
only thing we did.

E.: I don't believe you, you two were out until after one. Where did you go?

T.: To the hairdresser.

E.: Ooh, no, that's a lie!

T.: Not that bad.

E.: That's a horrible lie, too!

T.: Do you think that I'm lying to you?

E.: I know that you lied!

T.: If I told you the truth, it would break the bonds of friendship between you
and me.

E.: We used to be best friends, but, in the end, I found out that I couldn't
trust you.

T.: I didn't want to tell you the truth, but I did.

E.: What? You didn't tell me the truth?

T.: Yes, I did.

E.: Oh, really? You didn't have a chance to think about it beforehand? You
didn't stop to think about what would happen when you told me the truth?

T.: No. I didn't do that, but I could not avoid doing so.

E.: What could you avoid doing?

T.: Even though we are best friends, I can never trust you again.

E.: I know that you have lied to me.

T.: Okay, okay!

E.: I could not trust you again.

T.: No. I could not think of the consequences of telling you the truth.

E.: You've cheated on me.

T.: Not at all.

E.: "Not at all". That's just what all men say, dear!

T.: I only have to look in a mirror to see that my breasts are bigger than you
always admit. That's why you don't trust me.

E.: You have to look in a mirror to realize that your breasts are bigger than
mine, but I can't tell you why, because the reason behind that reasoning is
much larger than my brain.

T.: That's why I can't tell you why I have so much bigger breasts than you. I
also have to look in a mirror to know this, but it would be so stupid to tell
you why I have the opposite relationship with your breasts.

T.: I know that you're the only one to whom you talk with anything like
precision, but the reason why that's the case is so much smaller than the
reason why I can't share my most private thoughts with you.

E.: That's it, too! That's why I don't trust you, dear. I am also the only
specimen with whom I talk with the same amount of precision as you, and I know
why I keep things secret with you.

T.: I did not know that there were other specimens in the room with us, and,
so, we could become even more devoted than we were before, because we both
wanted to be there. That was your "reason".

T.: No, it wasn't like that. In the end, I, alone, left this room.

E.: You, alone, went into the room, and you have, alone, gone out of the room?

T.: Yes.

E.: What on earth did you feel when you turned the lights on?

T.: I felt like, as the stream of my blood was not mixing with the stream of my
ejaculate, it was not intermingling. I drank my blood, I drank my ejaculate,
and I enjoyed my pleasures.

E.: No.

T.: Yes, I did.

E.: You willed your blood to run out of your head.

T.: You were their best friend, and you were, now, completely satisfied.

E.: Why were you going to the hairdresser?

T.: You see, we two had to go out to get food, drinks, and a haircut. The third
specimen's hairdresser said to us that we should look at our breasts together.
When we examined them, the end of one of my breasts was dripping with blood. My
blood was already running. I had to squeeze the end of my penis and to put it
in my mouth. After I cleaned it, I was giving the saliva of my mouth to the end
of the other specimen's penis, and, I pushed the tip of my tongue inside the
mouth of my penis and inside its vagina. I licked its NSA. I tried to clean the
tip of my tongue with the end of the tip of my penis, I cleaned it, I sucked on
it, and then, I went on until I felt the tip of my tongue inside my mouth, I
licked the end of it and swallowed. My ejaculate was out of my body. I pushed
my tongue inside its mouth, slowly, and deep, and I licked it, I took the tip
of its tongue into my mouth, and I licked its lips. Finally, I closed my eyes
and I was inside my penis, and inside the vagina of the other specimen, and
inside its vagina, I went on again and again, until I felt the tip of my tongue
inside the mouth of its vagina, until I felt that I had spent all my ejaculate.
I swallowed. I had just stopped.

T.: I could not satisfy it.

E.: What?

T.: I had to put my finger in its mouth, and I had to taste its blood.

T.: I enjoyed this time of mutual satisfaction, and I know that it is
satisfied, but it is not satisfied, and I, at the same time, have an orgasm,
and I am fulfilled.

The specimens were satisfied, but they were not satisfied with each other. The
specimens found that they could connect and exchange mutual satisfaction, but
there was a fear, a denial, a mistrust of human touch that left them hungry for
human touch. In its moments of pleasure, they were separated by a screen. They
were, on that screen, shared a short-lived moment of mutual, mutual
satisfaction.

However, to use the term "touch" as they did, the specimens did not have sex
with each other, but, they shared, and, at some level, mutually satisfied each
other, for a short period of time, and for the first time, in their lives.
Their sex was about "touch", as it was not separated from their human blood.
The specimens had sex, but they did not have sex. They did not have sex with
each other, and they had an orgasm. However, they did not satisfy each other.
Each one of them found satisfaction in their desire to touch, and they
exchanged a moment of mutual, mutual satisfaction. However, to use the word
"touch", or to eat the same human feelings, values, and ideas, specimens have
to understand deeply inside them. Mutual satisfaction, then, is possible, if
one believes that they can be satisfied in that moment of pleasure. To
exchange, and not to exchange, is, as one said in "Briefless Man", impossible.
It is a matter of spirit.

Sex between specimens is about friendship, intimacy, respect, and love.

Sex between specimens is the recognition that, as a man said in "Briefless
Man", you can only have human touch when your life is inseparably linked with
the life of the other person.

Sex between men is the men's sex. When we have it with women, women experience
human touch as another part of our human blood. I don't find this very
interesting. I hope that you do too.

There are many ways to interpret and respond to these stories. Blood is human
touch. Blood is an inseparable part of each human being's blood. I find all of
this very interesting. I hope that you do too.

Today, four specimens are playing together, they got dressed, and they walked
home at the same time.

E.: Where are you going, dear?

T.: They got me an ugly outfit, and they took some time.

E.: You are out till the next morning! You really went out the night together?

T.: No.

E.: You! The two of you were out all night?

T.: No, we were out together till one in the morning.

E.: Oh, don't deny it!

T.: I didn't have a chance to think about what would happen when you told me
the truth? You didn't stop to think about what would happen when you told me
the truth?

E.: I didn't believe you when you said that you hadn't told the truth.

T.: I used to be your best friend. Now I can't trust you.

E.: That's a horrible lie, too!

T.: No, it's true.

E.: How could you betray me?

T.: Not that bad.

E.: I could not trust you again.

T.: I didn't want to tell you the truth.

E.: Do you know what you did?

T.: I lied to you.

E.: Yes, I know that.

T.: We've used to be best friends, but, in the end, I have trusted you, and I
know that you are the only specimen with whom I can have to speak about secret
things.

E.: Yes, you two could have stopped to think about the consequences when you
told me that you had the opportunity to be and you told me the truth.

T.: Yes, I was going to tell you, too.

E.: You turned out the lights, didn't stop to think about what would happen?

T.: No.

E.: You lied to me.

T.: How could I avoid doing that? I just had to tell you, and, now, you and I
have an orgasm.

T.: No.

E.: You lied to me.

T.: Yes.

E.: I know that you were telling me the truth.

T.: What have you done?

E.: I have, however, to leave you alone because I wanted to know how, where I
could not.

T.: I was so happy to be doing what the two of you were having.

E.: How do you like the two of us doing this together?

T.: That's how I think that you should be doing it.

E.: But this is impossible.

T.: I'm very tired.

E.: He, you lied to me about anything. I wouldn't believe you were.

T.: I didn't.

Their reactions, despite being equally enthusiastic, was nevertheless markedly
different. E., for instance, couldn't stop wondering why the onset of their
regimen was so evocative of thrilling and uneasy sexual undertones? T., on the
other hand, struggled to reconcile himself with a growing, shameful and
unavowed fetish for the semen of women who have sucked blood – the fate, so it
would learn, of so many blood vegan males. Neither could have imagined the
radical turn their sex life was about to take.

A few days into the carnivorous regimen of oral and anal blood-sucking (also
referred to as vampirism or vampire, etymologically speaking), a completely
unexpected thing happened: it seemed to the two vegans that they had just been
licked clean by some sexual entity. Neither of them recognized that this figure
who indulged in a full-sensory relationship with them, with its sexual and
non-sexual components, was other than their partners. The identity of the new
sexual companion was quite impossible to pinpoint. As it seemed to the latter,
both the penetration during oral sex and the rimming during anal sex
represented a one-in-a-million chance, but the fact of the matter is that it
wasn't they who consciously consented to this role-play, but they who were
seduced by it. A fortunate accident, they concluded. The first indicator that
they were dealing with a new sexual environment beyond the limits of their
imagination, an intimacy entirely outside the comfort zone they had ever
explored before was this unexpected outcome.

Most disturbing, it seemed so ordinary to them. They had licked and sucked one
another before in numerous scenes of boundless pleasure. The new scenario,
however, seemed to come without a penis. Both of them were disappointed by the
lack of that particular physical component but, even more, they felt
self-conscious about the lack of male sexual organs or semen. The simplest way
to neutralize their uncertainties was to consummate their relationship through
top/bottom "rape-sucking" or "oral biting". The seed of this term originates in
the course of time, the fusion of two of our closest relatives, which ignited,
as a by-product, an oral relationship of sadistic and masochistic undertone.

They came to understand that this relationship, this confrontation with a
figure they couldn't immediately recognize and this sexual engagement with a
level of mutual desire they haven't encountered before, was another poignant
sign, an indication of their well-being in relation to their social groups,
another indication of their progress towards their own modalities of monogamous
and non-monogamous couplings.

In the eyes of their friends and colleagues at work, though, the previous norms
fell by the wayside, as did their couple routine, a fact which wouldn't have
been more apparent had not their friends and colleagues greeted their informed
decision by an unbelievable reaction. It was everything but a guilty
expression. Both of them felt newly freed to take risks, to defy limits, to
expand their capacity of enjoyment to new highs and new lows. Despite their
fondness for monogamy, their urge to be together seemed to be replaced with a
desperate need to escape from any confinement by not willing to compromise on
their romantic preferences. The way they used their new discretion, confidence,
and flexibility seemed to speak more than a mile. An enjoyable yet excruciating
predicament this regimen of carnivorous blood-sucking was, at least for the
long-time pair of vegans.

They experienced their relationships as never before, an increasing need to be
alone and an equally intense desire to commune with their loved ones. Due to
this dynamic sensuality, the nature of their relationship kept changing. Days
spent together seemed to have been replaced by nights of passionate and
intricate fantasies. It went on until their arms, shoulders, and necks were
covered in poisonous pus-like or disgusting substances.

At some point, all the gloom dissipated: The dark cloud that covered their
relationships lifted. They were off their best, but their appetite for blood
remained as strong as ever and their eagerness to feast on the nourishment of
those who had nourished them was only encouraged by their strict nadir of
sexual energy.

When they realized that they wanted to feed on human flesh, they succumbed to
their cannibalistic urges, hiding their fetishes under the pretext of their
beloved vampirism. Let them have their trifling desires! This was a time of
life when everybody needs a vacation.
